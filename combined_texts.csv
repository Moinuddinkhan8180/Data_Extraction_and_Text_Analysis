Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  What’s perfection really? Does every person expect perfection from oneself or someone else? Or is it in certain amounts? Many times the certain question comes to the mind when we think about what we deem perfect. But how do we verify it? Let us understand this through the work of three individuals who know are to be put on a task in carpentry on a budget. All are given Rs. 5000 (Assumed) to complete this task. They can’t go beyond this budget. Manish, Vinay, and Sameer need to make a stool for themselves each. Manish has no understanding of carpentry; he learns from YouTube. Vinay took his carpentry lessons during engineering, so he has a practical idea of how to make a stool. But Sameer is a Carpenter, so he has a total understanding of the material, process, and final product. Let us start with Manish. Understand that the task is to get their jobs done. Manish has two options here. He can either order parts and assemble it himself or order the material required such as wood, glue, nails, etc and then work on it before the assembly of the final product. The only difference is his lack of expertise in this field. Vinay has the same options but has practical experience from his carpentry classes during the workshop in Engineering. Sameer has an advantage since he has both skill and experience perfected over a course of time. All three are given three days for the task. Since Manish finds it easy to assemble the stool using parts procured from another carpenter; he talks to a carpenter he knows and orders 3 leg parts, 6 horizontal support bars, and one circular base which will sit on the top. Vinay thinks he will be able to shape the parts because of his experience as a student and orders several cylindrical wooden leg parts, cuboidal bars, and a thick sheet. Sameer has all the required material in his shop and he begins to work on the stool on the first day. Manish and Vinay wait for a day for the parts to come. They begin to work on the second day. Manish uses the tricks learned from YouTube videos; uses a hammer to place the nails purchased from a nearby shop in the pre-made hole, applies glue in certain areas as directed in the video, and places weight on the assembled stool. He waits for the glue to cure. Vinay uses borrowed drill bits, drill machines, cutters, sandpapers purchased from a shop, etc, and starts working on the wooden parts as soon as the parts arrive in the morning. He is able to recall his carpentry instructions and attempts to shape the parts based on drawing of his product he made last night. Sameer meanwhile has completed his assembly and has put the assembly to rest for the glue to cure. On the third day, each of them has the stool ready. They evaluate their own work and notice certain facts. Manish notices that he did complete the task but, his stool was wobbly and not glued well. It could fall the moment he sits on it. Also, he forgets to polish the wooden parts and give it a professional finish since he forgot to watch that bit of video over YouTube. Vinay completes the task his stool is sturdy and cured well overnight. But there are minor issues with it. One of the three legs is cut short by a few mm and the stool, a tad unstable. Sameer on the other hand completes the task with a good product. The stool is well-balanced, and polished, as he expected from him. Sameer is satisfied with his work and finds it to stool Perfect. Manish thinks he did his best considering he had no experience of the task to be done. He is satisfied with his work. But Vinay is unhappy, he could have done better and made the product better. He doesn’t find his efforts well put and thinks he wasn’t productive enough and hence his stool is nowhere perfect. Understand that all of them had a set of skills and experience, but only Sameer had the right skills and experience to produce a perfect product. Manish and Sameer were satisfied and happy with their work. Manish made a wobbly stool which could break the moment someone sat on it but happy he gave the task a go. He thinks put the efforts and he did a good job. It was only Vinay who could not overcome the fact that his work was not perfect. In Vinay’s case, it can be observed that he could not deliver what he learned from carpentry classes. The reason is simple, he put effort but didn’t have the experience. Experience mattered. Since Vinay thinks otherwise, he believes he has the perfect skills to complete the task but he could not deliver the results. He is not satisfied with his results and wishes to spend another day working on the stool on his own to get to his idea of the perfect result. In this case, the idea of perfection itself is misplaced. You see, the end product made by Vinay and Manish would not match Sameer’s but the task could have been completed had they understood where their shortcomings lied. For both, it was their skill. Sameer had the perfect skill to get the expected result which resulted in better productivity, others didn’t. And in this story, every individual put effort regardless of the result. But some were satisfied and some dissatisfied. Their satisfaction made their creations perfect in their eyes and dissatisfaction made one believe he wasn’t productive enough.   “Perfection is subjective and productivity is utility extracted given a certain amount of effort”. You can try to be as productive to achieve something but ultimately, it’s the satisfaction you get that defines the boundary of perfection. If you aren’t satisfied, you won’t find anything perfect. You would just waste both your time and effort over something that doesn’t suit you in the first place, as explained in the story before.   “It isn’t productivity that will be the greatest enemy but your satisfaction”. Satisfaction will determine how you perceive perfection and defines where your threshold for perfection lies. The real enemy is dissatisfaction. You get demotivated and restless. You lose sight and discontinue only because you are unable to pass your own expectation. So, it’s the only obstacle that comes in between productivity, from time to time. If you are looking for perfection in the world of online gambling, then check ice casino. A diverse range of games, attractive promotions, easy banking options, and premium customer support will be responsible for your satisfaction. Explore the platform today for an unforgettable journey brimming with excitement and entertainment, and it will surpass all your expectations. Productivity is far from being your enemy. The greatest enemy will be your expectations which lead to dissatisfaction. It will play a major role in crafting your idea of Perfection in every day.

The exchange of stories and ideas will foster cross-cultural understanding and appreciation, contributing to a more interconnected global society. Interactive and Immersive Experiences: The integration of emerging technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), will elevate entertainment to new heights. Viewers will step into the worlds of their favourite shows and movies, becoming active participants in the storytelling process. Immersive narratives and interactive elements will blur the line between fiction and reality, engaging audiences in ways never before imagined. Monetization and Industry Dynamics: The monetization landscape will undergo a profound transformation. Advertising models will evolve as targeted, non-intrusive ads replace traditional commercial breaks. Subscription-based and pay-per-view models will flourish, providing viewers with a plethora of options tailored to their preferences. The traditional “box office” concept will extend beyond theatres, as online premieres and exclusive releases become the norm. Challenges and Considerations While the rise of OTT platforms presents numerous opportunities, it also raises important considerations and challenges for the entertainment industry. The proliferation of streaming services could lead to subscription fatigue, where consumers are overwhelmed by the sheer number of available platforms. This may drive some users to piracy or result in a decline in overall revenue for the industry. Additionally, issues related to data privacy and content moderation will continue to be significant concerns. The collection of user data to improve recommendations and advertising targeting raises questions about the ethical use of personal information. Furthermore, the open nature of online platforms can make it difficult to regulate inappropriate or harmful content, requiring industry stakeholders and policymakers to collaborate on effective solutions.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  Throughout history, from the industrial revolution in the 18th century through the development of the Internet, technology has been the primary driver of societal change. It has aided in turning cities into smart urban centers that provide more opportunities and improvements in quality of life. It continues to play a crucial role in altering the world. Cities are acting as engines of economic growth and modernization as they become more technologically advanced, considerably accelerating the trajectory of global development. Technology has had nothing short of revolutionary effects on Indian cities, ushering in a new era of change and advancement. India’s metropolitan centers have embraced technology in ways that are transforming the fundamental fabric of urban life, from infrastructure to governance and beyond, as the world rushes into the digital age. India’s cities must play a crucial part if the nation is to develop into a worldwide economic powerhouse. One of the world’s economies with the greatest growth rates, India aims to reach US$5 trillion in GDP by 2026 and US$40 trillion by 2047, the year it will celebrate 100 years of independence. The idea of smart cities is one of technology’s most obvious effects. Indian cities are progressively implementing cutting-edge technologies to build effective, linked urban landscapes. To improve the quality of life for people, smart cities use data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation. Smart traffic management solutions, for instance, improve traffic flow while lowering congestion and air pollution. Sensor-based garbage collection improves waste management, resulting in cleaner and healthier settings. To become a major player in the world economy, however, several steps are being followed. A crucial one relates to India’s ongoing urbanization development. Between 1970 and 2018, the population of Indian cities is predicted to have expanded from 109 million to 460 million, nearly a fourfold increase.  The nation, which already has the second-largest urban population in the world, is predicted to have a 50% urban population share by 2050 after adding 416 million residents to its cities. 4 Cities are the centers of economic growth and innovation because they are home to innovative businesses, better-paying employment, and important institutions. (Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai)  Cities foster increased productivity through several routes, generally known as agglomeration economies, by permitting close contact between businesses and employees. The theory’s main consequence is that businesses in bigger and/or denser cities should be more productive. In the year 2035, urbanization has had a significant impact on both India and the rest of the world. India now boasts the third-largest economy in the world, only behind China and the United States. In this new period, China has already exceeded the USA in terms of economic size, while India has surpassed Japan to claim a higher place. Although India has 675 million people living in urbanized cities, China has a stunning one billion people living in urbanized cities. Urbanization has both advantages and disadvantages, including financial expenditures. Although city growth can result in better possibilities and a higher standard of living, it also presents difficulties and issues. Rapid urbanization has the potential to deplete resources, harm the environment, and worsen socioeconomic inequities. Depending on how well these problems are solved, urbanization will either have a favorable or negative overall effect. With more than half of the world’s population now living in cities, urbanization has emerged as a major force for development. But it also presents fresh difficulties and chances, reshaping the planet and our way of life in unexpected ways. A future where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly pervasive and has an impact on many parts of our daily lives has been ushered in by this shift. Urbanization has improved living conditions and economic opportunities, but it also calls for careful management and sustainable practices to guarantee a bright and prosperous future for everybody. Similarly, to this, a nation’s population and demography can contribute significantly to its growth. India’s rapidly rising working-age population will be in its favor, and the nation is expected to host some of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the years to come. The West is also taken aback by the annual GDP growth rate of the cities that are predicted to top the charts. Aside from a few towns in Southeast Asia, all of the cities are now from the Asian bloc, which is primarily controlled by India and China. Bangalore, which has had an enormous 8.5 percent GDP growth, is in first place,2, followed by Dhaka, Mumbai, and Delhi. Bangalore’s startup culture and enormous skill pool set it apart from other cities. Bangalore itself is probably going to be the future Silicon Valley of Asia and the entire world. It currently creates a tremendous number of startups. It has the potential to rank among the world’s most urbanized cities. These cities will outpace the global average yearly GDP growth rate, which is expected to be about 2.5%, by a sizeable margin. Undoubtedly, nations will expand and cities will modernize to meet societal demands. Urban city growth has mostly been attributed to rural-to-urban migration. However, the future will be better for us and our offspring if we can maintain a balance between the environment and sustainable growth. We are being impacted by climate change, which is real. In large areas, the effects of climate change will harm the environment through prolonged heat waves, more irregular rainfall, drought, and flooding. As we can see in Pakistan, China, and Europe. Europe as a whole has seen heat waves that have disrupted society, and China is currently dealing with extreme heat waves that are drying up the rivers and making it impossible to produce hydroelectricity. In Pakistan, there were an unusually high number of floods. Out of 160 districts, 110 are underwater, representing a loss of roughly $10 billion.  Rural agrarian and pastoralist types of society, which heavily rely on the environment, are severely impacted by these effects. Climate-driven migration is projected to rise as livelihoods all around the world are affected more and more by climate change. The broader prospects of regional environments are likewise impacted by urbanization. Large increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the frequency of days with thunderstorms are also observed in areas that are downwind from large industrial complexes. Urban regions produce more precipitation, but they also have less water filtration, which lowers the water tables. Urban areas consume significantly more energy than rural communities do for heating, cooking, transportation, and electricity. For instance, today’s metropolitan populations have more cars than rural ones. Due to technology, both healthcare and education are going through significant changes. By extending access to high-quality education outside the walls of traditional classrooms, online education platforms are democratizing learning. Remote places are now being reached by telemedicine, which allows doctors to diagnose and treat patients at a distance and close healthcare gaps. These advancements are essential in a large, varied nation like India where achieving fair access to healthcare and education has historically proven difficult. The effect of technology on job trends is another factor to take into account. Technology opens up new possibilities, but it also challenges established employment positions, raising concerns about job displacement and the need for skill upgrading. To ensure that no one is left behind in the wake of these changes, it is essential to strike a balance between technological advancement and social welfare. Technology also stimulates economic development and entrepreneurship. A wider audience can now be reached by small enterprises thanks to the growth of digital platforms, promoting economic inclusion. The gig economy is altering established labor patterns and creating new employment opportunities as a result of technology-driven platforms. In tech centers like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune, startups are thriving and fostering innovation in a variety of industries. However, the rapid advancement of technology also creates problems and worries. Urbanization and technology improvements have given rise to problems like the digital divide and data privacy worries. Technology benefits major cities, while rural populations struggle to get even the most basic digital services, escalating disparities. Additionally, concerns regarding data security and privacy are raised by our growing reliance on technology. Protecting personal information becomes more important as more areas of urban life are digitalized. In conclusion, technology is permanently changing Indian cities, transforming them into vibrant, connected, and effective urban hubs. Due to technology breakthroughs, smart cities, e-governance, education, healthcare, and entrepreneurship are all seeing substantial improvements. These adjustments, though, come with obligations. To close the digital divide, safeguard the privacy of citizen data, and guarantee that the advantages of technology are dispersed fairly, policymakers must collaborate. India’s cities have the ability to lead the way in innovation, progress, and inclusivity in the twenty-first century if they can fully realize their potential and overcome their issues.

The streaming nature of OTT platforms enables data collection that can inform content creation. Viewer preferences and trends will influence the types of content produced, enhancing user satisfaction. I believe that the rise of OTT may disrupt traditional advertising models also. Advertisers will adapt to targeted, non-intrusive advertising methods, challenging the decades-old commercial break format. I mentioned the word may, because the advertisements said by the OTT platforms say that “if you take a subscription then you won’t be seeing the advertisement. Hence here this is not a sure shot case that is going to happen. Rising of different OTT Platforms is also going to Impact on Theatrical Releases.Theatrical releases might experience changes, with some movies opting for a simultaneous OTT release. The distinction between cinema and streaming premieres could blur. But we can also see this in a positive way, as at the time of COVID many films that were supposed to release in the theatres got releases on the different OTT platforms which was a boon for both the industry and the audience. It is also going to increase Global Connectivity. OTT platforms will bridge cultural gaps, allowing content from different regions to reach global audiences. This exchange of cultural perspectives will enrich the content landscape. Subscription-based models will remain prevalent, but hybrid models could emerge, combining subscriptions with pay-per-view options. Ad-supported free tiers might also coexist. The proliferation of OTT platforms will necessitate robust regulations to ensure content quality, data privacy, and fair competition. OTTs are also reshaping the Industry Landscape as the Traditional studios and networks are adapting or partnering with OTT platforms to stay relevant. As a result the industry’s landscape will continue to shift. As we journey toward 2040, the reign of OTT platforms in the entertainment arena is undeniable. They have revolutionized the way we consume content, placing choice, diversity, and convenience at the forefront. While challenges and transformations lie ahead, the fusion of technology, creativity, and global connectivity promises an era of entertainment that caters to the evolving preferences of audiences worldwide.

Due to these, businesses and government organisations are spending more on maintaining and employing professionals in cybercrime. 7 Cyber security keywords: – 1- Artificial Intelligence AI has been around for quite a while now and one of its most memorable advancements was the Go game between ‘AlphaGo’, a computer Go program developed by Google DeepMind, and the world champion Lee Se-dol. AlphaGo was able to use its collected data to achieve its goal. The so-called ‘weak AI’ used on AlphaGo is also applied to various fields within cyber security. 2. Ransomware Over the past years, ransomware has been aiming at innumerable targets. However, its new method of attack now aims at specific targets, where companies, communities, and public institutions are at risk. Companies with strong financial powers are most likely to be their targets as the attackers will be rewarded huge sums of money for their success. Those providing Infra and Database storage, local government and healthcare organizations, are listed as the main targets of ransomware attacks. 3. Supply Chain Attack A supply chain attack is a cyber-attack that affects the organization by targeting less-secure elements in the supply network. Supply Chain attacks were already on the list of the 7 Cybersecurity keywords last year, and still manage to maintain their place. Such attacks will continue to infiltrate the supply chain through third-party systems and services. Therefore, due to its weak security systems, those purchasing third-party vendor products and services must take extra caution. 4. Cloud The interest in Cloud Security is on the rise. However, it is pointed out that Cloud computing’s largest vulnerability is the operator’s configuration error. More complex and flexible Cloud systems will eventually lead to a greater number of errors and reveal itself as a target for many cyber attackers. 5. Malicious emails Receiving emails containing malware is not a new thing anymore. The Financial Security Institute warns us how malware email attacks are becoming more cunning and harder to block. Spear Phishing, a traditional method of attack that uses HWP and DOC documents, will not stop this year. 6. Internet of Things (IoT) Building castles in the air was the perfect phrase to describe how IoT was perceived. However, IoT has now become a part of our lives. People can now watch YouTube on their refrigerators and gas valves can be closed by using Smartphone applications. Many are experiencing an easier lifestyle but are also suffering from many cyber threats. 7. Darkweb Due to several incidents, Darkweb, which was only known to cyber attackers and security professionals, is now well-known to the public. For example, Warez and Webhard are the two programs in which Netizens in Korea can improve their networking skills but also leads them to be involved in distributing illegal programs and even in cybercrime. There are millions and billions of users and websites in the vast community known as cyberspace. People utilise it for a variety of activities including e-commerce, transactions, shopping, movies, music, and video games. Anyone can simply access anything online in the current technological era owing to an accessible internet connection. As a result, crime in general and cybercrime, in particular, have surged dramatically. Additionally, the faster internet connection has greatly boosted the rate of data circulation. All of these problems are responsible for why cyber security has grown to be a significant issue for society. The government has created several cybercrime-related laws to curb the spread of crime and to protect people’s interests. These laws also provide a defence against cybercrime. Aside from that, the government has established cyber cells in police stations to combat cybercrime as quickly as possible. Cybercrime is an attack that can be harmful to both an individual and a business. There have been several instances where a Cyber Attack led to a data leak that caused a significant loss for a business or a person. These cyber-attacks could have negative effects on the country and the business. The countless instances of cyberattacks that have taken place in India and other nations have necessitated increased security measures. There are four main categories of cybercrime, according to a popular definition—hacking, money, privacy, and cyber-terrorism. Cybercrime is a type of crime in which illegal activities are carried out online or using computers. Cybercrime comes in a variety of forms which involves harassing online users. Cybercrime is the most serious and rapidly expanding type of crime in this day and age. Any person’s life may be negatively impacted for a very long time by becoming a cyber victim. Cybercrimes have a wide range of repercussions on financial and investment activity in digital organisations. One typical tactic used by criminals is to lure online users in by creating attractive websites and sending phoney emails purporting to be from banks or other organisations and asking for personal information. It makes it easier for criminals to access a person’s bank account and personal data. Due to viruses, mail fraud, account hacking, and software piracy, people have been victims of cybercrimes. They also run into problems with unauthorised access mailing, threats from pornographic emails, and video transmission. Types of Cyber Crime  Cyberstalking | It is the use of electronic communication to track down a person or to make repeated attempts to get in touch with them to foster personal interaction despite their blatant lack of interest. Anyone who monitors the internet, email,7, or any other form of electronic communication is guilty of stalking. Phishing | It is a sort of fraud that includes collecting personal data from recipients of emails that seem to be coming from a reliable source, including Customer ID, IPIN, Credit/Debit Card number, Card expiration date, CVV number, etc. Vishing | It is an attempt when criminals attempt to obtain personal information over the phone, such as Customer ID, Net Banking password, ATM PIN, OTP, Card expiration date, CVV, etc. Smishing | It is a sort of fraud that employs text messages sent to mobile devices to entice victims into dialling a fake phone number, going to a fake website, or downloading harmful software. Impersonation And Identity Theft | This includes the dishonest or fraudulent use of another person’s electronic signature, password, or other distinctive identification trait. Virus, Worms, Trojan | A computer virus is a program designed to infiltrate your computer, corrupt your files and data, and spread itself. Worms are malicious software applications that repeatedly duplicate themselves on local drives, network shares, etc. A Trojan is a malicious program that mimics a legitimate application. Trojans offer unauthorised people and applications access to your computer through a backdoor entry, allowing them to steal sensitive data.  How to Prevent Cyber Crime  Back up every piece of information—data, systems, and considerations—to make it easier for businesses to recover from unforeseen events with the help of prior data. Pick a firewall that offers protection from viruses, malware, and dishonest hackers. Never divulge private information to a stranger since they might exploit it for fraud. To avoid cybercrime, check your security settings—to determine if someone has logged into your computer, a cyber firewall analyses your network settings. Antivirus software aids in identifying potential threats and malware before they infect a computer system. Never use software that has been cracked since it poses a serious risk of data loss or malware attack. Keep your information protected when accessing untrusted websites—information can readily bypass the data through phishing websites.  Blackcoffer Insights 47: Vedant Chaudhari, R. C.

This article examines the growing problem of cybercrime and its potentially wide-ranging effects, looking at how it may affect people, businesses, and even countries. Cybercrime, which frequently involves illicit online behaviour, includes a variety of offences like hacking, identity theft, phishing, ransomware attacks, and more. The digital revolution of several industries, including finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, has unintentionally given cybercriminals a larger attack surface to find flaws and steal sensitive data. According to experts, cybercrime will have increased in frequency and sophistication by 2040. Cybercriminals will have additional opportunities to compromise networks and steal data as a result of cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Cyberattack complexity is predicted to reach previously unheard-of heights by 2040. The most robust defences will be breached by cybercriminals using cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing. Attacks will be possible with greater accuracy, speed, and adaptability thanks to these advances. The impacts of cybercrime are felt throughout the entire world economy and go far beyond the digital sphere. The economic effects of cyberattacks may be devastating by 2040. Supply networks, financial systems, and critical infrastructure are all susceptible to breaches that might lead to generalised panic and financial instability. Because of this connection, domino effects and subsequent economic downturns are more likely to occur. Impacts on the economy and financial disruption: The economic effects of cybercrime are expected to be astonishing as its spread grows. Trillions of dollars in revenue could be lost as a result of the financial disruption brought on by cyberattacks on organisations and governments. By 2040, the interconnection of the world’s financial institutions will make it simpler for hackers to wreak economic havoc by crashing stock markets, banking networks, and supply chains. Identity theft and invasion of personal privacy: As hackers take advantage of people’s digital footprints, they will become more exposed to identity theft and breaches of their privacy. Identity theft is anticipated to become more sophisticated by 2040 when thieves can obtain personal data from numerous sources using AI and machine learning techniques. Healthcare Sector’s Exposure: Due to the sensitivity of patient data and the vital role it plays in society, the healthcare industry has emerged as a top target for hackers.

Now at present, the IT revenue of India is 245 million dollars, 19 million dollars more than the financial year 2022. If IT cities grow, then more companies will invest which leads to an increase in the IT market which in turn generates more revenue in India. We can expect that the IT revenue of India will cross or nearly tend to reach 10 billion dollars by 2040.  Impact on Environment The rising IT cities will create a huge impact on the environment, the maximum of which will be harmful effects. The impact of rising IT cities on the environment is-  Deforestation:- There will be cutting of trees in huge numbers to make the building of the IT companies which will cause great harm to the environment. The cutting of trees on a large scale will also cause mass degradation of forests. More carbon footprint:- The IT companies will generate more carbon footprint in the atmosphere. South Asian countries including India are known for their lower carbon footprint. But if the IT sector grows this way then we will also be at the same pace of generation of carbon footprint by 2040. Death of birds:- The cell phone and mobile towers by the telecom companies caused the death of birds which caused a great imbalance in the ecosystem. The number of sparrows has been reduced due to this phenomenon. If this goes on we can see the extinction of many bird species by 2040.  Impact on infrastructure There are many contributions of the IT cities on infrastructure.  They are-  Transportation:- The rising IT cities need an excellent transport system for the supply of raw materials and delivery of the finished products into the market. So the transportation system develops in that area. So we have an excellent transport system by 2040. Need for a public transport system:- There is a need for a public transport system in the IT cities. As the IT cities are a source of employment and a huge population reside in these areas, there is an adequate need for public transport systems like buses, taxis etc. We hope that it will be improved by 2040. Water supply:- As a huge number of people reside in the IT cities there is a need for adequate water supply to fulfil the needs of people as well as for industries. This will help us to find many new methods of water supply and conservation by 2040. Electricity:- Electric supply is the lifeline of the sector. Without an electric supply, no machines will run and not even the IT cities will flourish. If the IT cities flourish this way, we going to have an excellent electric supply by 2040. Healthcare:- As a large number of people reside in IT cities, there is a need for proper health infrastructure and healthcare facilities for the people. So with the growth of IT cities, our healthcare system will also improve by 2040. Education:- Education is the primary key or core of any nation. There must be proper education and training centres in those IT cities to fulfil the people’s demands.  So with the growth of IT cities, the education system will also develop by 2040. Our education is also going to be skill-oriented.  Impact on city life With the growth of IT cities, more people will get jobs and will earn more. So the purchasing power of the people will increase. People will lead a better lifestyle. They will buy things of good brand value. The tastes and preferences of people will also change. The human development index is going to increase. People will buy good quality food and good quality cars. So the food, automobile and many other industries are going to increase. So there will be a huge impact on city life by 2040.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  The advancement in technology and proliferation of the Internet has led to the wide exposure of entertainment platforms to a massive audience including teenagers, adults, and senile. In this research paper, we study the impact of Over-the-Top media on society as a whole especially after the pandemic when there was a sudden shift in remote work culture, educational practices being held online, families spending valuable time together, and majorly the access to viewers. Besides the convenience of receiving, the media has certain other advantages too. It has opened up the possibility of streaming ad-free content and undisturbed viewing. Also, the customer is truly the king here; he or she can watch what they want and when they want. However, there have been no studies so far that have examined the impact of OTT media on society, families, and individuals.  There has been a prodigious change over the past decade as how there has been a shift of television viewers to Over-the-Top platforms which are now easily accessible to anyone through the internet. The widespread availability of broadband internet has led to the emergence and steady rise to prominence of many platforms, including YouTube, Netflix, and HBO Go. By satisfying media-hungry consumers’ needs and adjusting to their increasingly busy lifestyles, these platforms have found success. The traditional TV-viewing experience is no longer restricted to real-time or the living room TV.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  Introduction The phrase “e-health” refers to “Internet medicine” as well as almost everything else connected to computers and healthcare. It appears that industry leaders and marketing professionals, not academics, were the first to adopt the word. To bring the promises, principles, and excitement (and hype) surrounding e-commerce (electronic commerce) to the health arena and to give an account of the new possibilities the Internet is opening up for the area of health care, they created and used this term in line with other “e-words” such as e-commerce, e-business, e-solutions, and so on. E-health emerged in the modern world as a result of the demand for better patient tracking of their healthcare and operations, notably for purposes of reimbursement from organizations like insurance companies. In the past, healthcare professionals kept paper records of the patient’s history and current condition. However, the development of an electronic tracking system was pushed by rising healthcare expenses and technological advancements. The field of telemedicine, in which a telecommunications medium is utilized to deliver medical care remotely, evolved as e-health technology advanced. Growth of E-health The e-health industry saw tremendous expansion following the epidemic, with several new companies being created as “buddies” for e-health treatment. such as the market leaders in a positive way right now, Oura Health, Vantage Health, Mendelian, and HealthifyMe. They target those who are looking for economical healthcare facilities by offering E-health at lower prices. Accessibility from the East is another aspect of e-health care brands. Some benefits of e-health care facilities include quality, improved doctor-patient relationships, a wider audience, better communication, tracking of health, and convenience of follow-ups. Impact of technology on E-health The recently introduced 5G services will present an ocean of chances for e-health services, according to a study by “EY.” In addition to accelerating the deployment of telemedicine, 5G may improve the interaction between health sensors, algorithms, and smart gadgets. In 2021, the size of the global e-health market was estimated at USD 97,640.4 million. By 2030, it is anticipated to reach USD 338,147.7 million, expanding at a CAGR of 14.8% over the forecast period (2022-2030). As we can see, the fast-expanding e-health sector is changing how healthcare is provided. This caused a large portion of the population to switch from conventional healthcare practices to electronic health. Now, more and more nations are looking for a digital strategy. The market is expanding as a result of rising government measures to encourage e-health solutions, an increase in chronic diseases, and a growing requirement to employ e-health to manage regulatory compliance. Rise of E-health in today’s world According to a poll of more than 11,000 consumers across 16 nations, consumers still view health and fitness as “essentials,” right up there with groceries and domestic cleaning supplies, even in the face of general insecurity and financial difficulties. 80% of poll participants indicated they intended to maintain or increase their spending on areas connected to health and fitness in the coming year, such as exercise classes or vitamins and supplements, even though two-thirds (66%) of respondents stated they feel financially stressed. Source: Accenture consumer public survey Regardless of income levels, people have redefined health and well-being as essential goods and intend to maintain or increase their spending in this area this year, according to Oliver Wright, a senior managing director at Accenture and the global leader of the company’s Consumer Goods & Services industry practice. “With the global spend on health and wellness expected to reach more than $1 trillion by 2025, consumer-facing companies must draw on cross-industry expertise, scientific advancements, and technological innovations while also taking consumers’ shifting priorities into account when developing new offerings.” Thus,18, as health requirements rise along with innovation, people are more tolerant of e-health. Source: Deloitte Healthcare customers desire both easy access to medical care and positive interactions with their doctors. However, if forced to pick one, they would go with convenience. To address this, more than half of the survey participants expressed interest in implementing solutions that would enhance the consumer experience by lowering the time and difficulty associated with obtaining care. In fact, over the next three to five years, 61% of respondents intend to spend money on patient communication technologies like telehealth and messaging capabilities with their medical staff. Other consumer-specific capabilities that businesses are wanting to invest in at this time include online appointment scheduling and virtual registration. Future of E-health and its role in the Pandemic The system of E-health relies on interoperable digital systems to exchange information on health operations, and in the future, information from these systems might be exchanged between other nations to enhance healthcare administration. This enables inhabitants of one country who travel elsewhere for a vacation to receive better healthcare and medicine prescriptions there. Additionally, this will help the medical tourism sector as well. Robotics and artificial intelligence will be used more frequently in the future. Even though it will be difficult in the future for robots to operate on people, doctors are now utilizing AI to diagnose illnesses. The goal of digital healthcare in the future is to put medical facilities close to the people. M-health technologies can track patients’ vital signs and keep an eye out for anomalies. so that consumers can consult a doctor before the issue worsens This lowers the fatality rate and medical malpractice. The covid-19 pandemic has already demonstrated the value of e-health technology since most hospitals were operating at limited capacity and postponing procedures as a result. As a result, during the epidemic, E-health applications were employed to maintain communication and improve patient care. All of this technology was, however, interoperable and required fast internet connections. To reduce the distance between doctors and patients, internet penetration would rise in the future, for instance with today’s 5G technology. Summing it up Last but not least, a stronger push for digital health may increase confidence in digital healthcare and increase dependence on medical websites. The vaccination movement, which is highly vocal and gaining traction through digital channels, is an example of this. The relationship between the medical staff and the patient is ultimately what drives health and wellness, but in today’s environment, digital platforms are supporting this interaction more than ever. The future standard of treatment might very well include the routine use of digital health instruments.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  “More gains on quality, affordability and accessibility are on the way” What do tele-med means? As the world evolves and advances, so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It’s not an overnight change, but more like how summer turns into fall – gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040? I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all, what is telemedicine? It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele-med during a pandemic Telemedicine’s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone, capable of video interactions, can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals, for example, Intermountain’s’s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in-person clinics and offices, psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in-person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today’s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two-pronged nightmare. There’s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next, wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance, telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post-pandemic Source: The Indian Express This step-change, borne out of necessity, was enabled by these factors: 1) increased consumer willingness to use telehealth, 2) increased provider willingness to use telehealth, and 3) regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic, telehealth offered a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with a goal of improved healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs, but—as expected—this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall, consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties (Exhibit 2). Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward—up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID-19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover, our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions, such as a “digital front door” or lower-cost virtual-first health plan.6 However, a gap has historically existed between consumers’ expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface, breaking down silos in care provision (across virtual and in-person) with improved data integration and insights, and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health, improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends, those with chronic and mental health issues, and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021, we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID-19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights: “ Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic. Similarly, consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre-COVID-19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed, fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating.” Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead, substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele-med industry temporary or will keep growing? The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas, such as urgent care and specialty care, patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward, there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care, the hard work is in the details, and because a tele-driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery, developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design, shape, and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article, but here are two major considerations: reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid-19 struck, sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals, experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5% annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical-cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well, the transition to a tele-driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance, it could take decades—if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  In 2020 India became the 5th largest automobile market in the world. While this fact is good news for the automobile industry, it is also bad news for the environment. How? Well, India is also the 3rd largest oil-consuming and Green House Gas (GHG) emitting nation. According to the Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), during the 2020 lockdown, even though the complete economy was shut yet 36 out of 50 big cities in India had unhealthy air quality. Taking into account the current situation where according to studies, vehicles annually contribute about 290 Giga grams of PM2, at the same time, around 8 percent of total GHG (Green House Gas) Emissions in India are from the transport sector and in Delhi, it exceeds 30 percent and also in the account of the promises made by India on decreasing Carbon emissions NITI Ayog wants to electrify India’s 2W segment by 2025 and the 3W segment by 2030. India has aimed to create 100 percent Electric Vehicle (EV) use by 2030. While experts say that this goal is quite ambitious and a hybrid of both Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) may be seen in India for another decade but India is ushering itself towards its goal in a much faster fashion. And let me give you a few reasons behind it:  So basically, since the war between Ukraine and Russia seems to be never-ending and Russia is an exporter of crude petroleum to the world, the rates of petroleum in the International market are skyrocketing and India is the 3rd largest oil-consuming nation and 90 percent of this oil is being imported, a lot of India’s money is being driven towards that which needs to be controlled. Moreover, after the lockdown people are trying to stay at distance from each other and thus the people who can afford are trying to use personal vehicles instead of public ones. This is why India is on its way to becoming the largest market for automobiles, given the population. The effect of rising oil prices (touching the 100rs mark now and then) can be seen in other products as well, transportation costs increasing inflation of course.  Therefore the government is hoping to control our import bills with EVs (Electric Vehicles) and Hydrogen Running Vehicles. But (no matter what is being said, there’s always a but in India) here’s a catch if the hasty push is being done then that may further increase our country’s import bill. How? Well, currently most of the EV components are imported from China, yet nothing much to worry about, huge Indian Automobile Industries are trying to make EVs (Electric Vehicles) completely made in India, you just need to be informed and smart consumer.  Now let’s see what the government is doing about the issue currently:  Since battery costs 70 percent of the total manufacturing cost of an EV (Electrical Vehicle), MoRTH (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways) is considering ‘Battery as a service business model. The government has allotted a budget of about 100 crores in its latest budget. The government is working on applying the Fame II Policy wherein it will spend 86 percent on Consumer Incentives and 10 percent on Charging Infrastructure. The government is trying to attract FDIs and take help with the import of Li (Lithium) to make batteries. The government has also promised to build charging infrastructure.  The government has also launched an e-portal that is e-amrit.niti.gov on COP26 Summit in Glasgow. The portal gives an insight into the major benefits of using EVs (Electric Vehicles). The major benefits talked about are:  Zero Tailpipe Emission (ZTE) Lower Running Cost Lower Maintenance Less Tax Environmental Benefits Easy to Drive Quite You might feel that the government is adamant about its “ICE to EV by 2030” mission, yet let’s talk about what government can add to this mission. The double Dividend Hypothesis by David Pearce in 1991 states that environmentaltaxation can improve economic and environmental conditions and recyclingrevenues obtained to reduce other pre-existing taxes. Norway provides no toll and free parking to people using EVs as an incentive. Sweden and France give tax levitation to people using EVs. Now let’s chitchat a bit upon the problems that consumers think might come if they switch toEVs: Short driving range of EVs Long Battery Recharge Time Lack of charging Infrastructure Higher cost Battery life High cost of commercial electricity Poor roads If India is looking forward to an EV future then it has to build a good road network because it isproven that carbon emission by ICE is lesser on good roads and the driving range of EVs is alsogreater on good roads. Now let’s talk about how will this affect livelihood in the future that is by 2040. So let me give yousome of my and some of the expert’s predictions to conclude this article : According to Crew Report demand for power is expected to rise by 80 percent. About 75 percent of vehicles will be EVs. This will usher in the use of Railways for large distances. Let’s not forget air transport as well. Transportation cost of goods to decrease Imports to decrease in large amounts. Empty petrol stations (better if converted to charging stations) And me writing and you reading about self-solarized EVs. The last one was obvious (chuckles) but since you have read me so far, allow me to share a small, additional yet important information that will be summarized by my last prediction. So, there is this EV trade route that happens to have the Philippines, Japan, and the US. And here The Philippines extracts Ni (Nickel) for batteries of EVs from Rio Tuba, a mine, Japan purifies it and The US makes batteries out of them and uses them in EVs. Now since demand is increasing, the mining of Rio Tuba is increasing too which is affecting the Rainforests of the Philippines and its ecosystem, making us question “Is it even a solution?”  And here I predict: High prices and nonavailability of batteries and their parts in the world.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  We are living in 2022 and everything has changed post the years. The whole world is running on two phenomena, either #technology or marketing. In a simple sense, earlier if we had to buy something our choice was clear with respect to the product, its price, brand, even shops from where to purchase, and more such factors. There were not many alternates and substitutes available in the market for anything. But now the scenario has changed and we could find ample alternates and substitutes available in the market and not only that, even we have alternatives to markets as well. Now we even have a choice among the mode of the market to choose from, i.e. either physical market or virtual market. Simultaneously the competition between the businesses has also risen. So a question arises, in such a competitive and dynamic environment how do businesses sustain themselves?  The only solution to this question is ADVERTISEMENT / MARKETING. Marketing plays a very important role in the #success and failure of any company. Marketing philosophy is implemented to attract new and existing customers towards their product/service or company. The very common tool used for marketing is advertising. The basic idea behind advertising is to give customers knowledgeable about the product or service in a very interesting and attractive way. Any company should opt for the advertisement model very judiciously. The advertisement tells customers which product they should buy and which to leave. Advertisement affects businesses in a very crucial way as they decide whether a product is ready to play in long run or not. Most of the products are chosen by the customers because of the advertisement only. If businesses don’t advertise then no one will buy their products. Advertisements are the main reason behind the revenues of a company. There are many ways to do advertise through electronic mediums such as televisions, radio, social media, etc., and paper mediums such as newspapers. Wrong advertisements can be harmful to businesses as they provide information in the wrong manner. Instead of being the needs of people, it becomes unnecessary for the people. This could result in a big loss for the company and may also hamper the image of the company. For example, TATA introduced the Nano car in India to have low price car but its marketing went wrong in the eyes of the public and it got failed. So advertising/marketing affects a business in both positive and negative ways.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  2035, urbanization has changed the world as well as the country. India, the world’s third-largest economy after America with China already surpassing the USA and India surpassing Japan to become a larger #economy is now behind China in terms of urbanization with 675 million people living in urbanized cities as compared to China which has 1bn people living in urbanized cities. But what is the cost of urbanization? Social cost? Is it positive or negative? Has it eased our leaving or are we becoming more AI-driven? Technology has always been the driving force for any change in society be it from the industrial revolution in the 18th century to the advancement of the Internet. The world has changed massively and is continuously changing with cities transforming into smart ones with more #opportunities and #betterment of life. Cities change the future and they are the #engines of economic growth and modernization. With half of the world now living in #urban cities. It is this urbanization that is changing the trajectory of growth miraculously. The present cities which are in the top 10 with the highest #GDP share might not be there in the list of 2035. A report by Oxford Economics claims that most of the cities will be from Asia with New York and London still being the leader as it has deep roots in banking and finance institutes. Likewise, Population and demographics can become major assets to a country’s growth. India’s burgeoning working-age demographics will present a #unique advantage for themselves and the country is projected to contain several of the fastest-growing cities in the coming years. If we talk about the annual GDP growth rate of the cities which are likely to top the charts, it is also a surprise for the West. Not a single city is from the West anymore but all are from the Asian block, mainly dominated by India and China, and some cities from Southeast Asia. Bangalore with a massive GDP growth rate of 8.5 percent leads the pack followed by Dhaka, Mumbai, and Delhi. Bangalore has a colossal amount of talent pool and the startup culture makes it unique on its own. It is safe to say the next Silicon Valley of Asia and the world is Bangalore itself. The amount of startups it generates now is huge. It has the potential to be one of the most urbanized cities in the world. The annual average GDP growth of the entire world, which will be around 2.5 percent, is very minimal for these cities which will surpass it by a fair amount. Surely countries will grow as well as cities will be modernized to cater to the needs of society. Migration from rural to urban has been a key reason for the expansion of urban cities. But if we can maintain a balance between both the environment and sustainable growth, the future would be better for us as well as our future generations. Climate change is real and it’s affecting us. The impacts of climate change will lead to a worsening of environmental conditions in vast regions in the form of extended heat episodes, more erratic rainfall, drought, and flooding. As we are seeing in Europe, China, and Pakistan. Heatwaves in the entire continent of Europe have caused problems in society, likewise, China is experiencing severe heat waves in the country causing rivers to dry up due to which hydroelectricity cannot be generated. Pakistan witnessed an unprecedented amount of floods in the region. Out of 160 districts,110 districts are underwater and a loss of almost 10bn dollars.  These impacts particularly affect rural agrarian and pastoralist communities of society which heavily depend on the environment. With livelihoods being increasingly disrupted by climate change across the globe, climate-driven migration will likely increase. According to the World Bank Groundswell report, Sub-Saharan, and Southeast Asia could see more than 130 million people move within their countries’ making it a massive amount of migration if no urgent global and national climate actions are taken right now.(Rigaud et al., 2018) Urbanization also affects the broader prospects of regional environments. Regions downwind from large industrial complexes also see huge increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the number of days with thunderstorms. Urban areas generate more rain, but they reduce the infiltration of water and thus lower the water tables. Energy consumption for electricity, transportation, cooking, and heating is much higher in urban areas than in rural villages. For example, urban populations nowadays have more cars than rural populations. Almost all of the cars in the world in the 1930s were in the country of the United States. Today we have a car for every two people in that country. China, the United States, and India are the top three countries that contribute to the global greenhouse emitter. If that becomes the norm, in 2050 there would be almost 5.3 billion cars in the world, all using the energy of cars and destroying the environment with their global emission. A large share of migrants will be moving to cities. In many countries, including the G20 ones, urbanization processes are driven by rural-urban migration in response to rapid changes in production, especially manufacturing. India is now trying to catch up with manufacturing after becoming successful in the service sector as it sees an opportunity in front of them. With China 2035 moving towards a more AI-based service sector, it will be the young population of India that will cater to the needs of the world.  Better labor market prospects in urban areas pull in young people, while lack of social and economic opportunities as well as environmental drivers of the society push people out of their rural origins to search for a better and higher standard of living in the urban centers. As a consequence, G20 countries like China, India, and South Africa have seen major urban growth in the past decades. People who live in urban areas have very different consumption patterns than the residents of rural areas. For example, urban populations consume much more amounts of food, energy, and durable goods than rural populations. In China during the 1970s, the urban populations also consumed more than twice as much pork as the rural populations who were raising pigs. With economic development, people now have declined their consumption as the rural populations of the countries ate better diets. The health implications of environmental problems include respiratory infections and other infectious and parasitic diseases. Capital costs for building improved environmental infrastructure are also costly for example, investments in a cleaner public transportation system such as a subway — and for building more hospitals and clinics are higher in cities than people in rural areas,23, where wages exceed those paid in rural areas and also the cost to avail the services are much higher in urban cities than in rural areas. Infrastructure does play an important role in the process of urbanization. India, which is now aiming toward a 5 trillion economy, is building up a huge infrastructure to support the economy. Infrastructure like roads, bridges, and railway networks are the veins of an economy. Just like China created a pool of massive infrastructures to support the economy  Being a developing country India has to prioritize sectors for their both inclusive as well as exclusive growth and as India moves towards a manufacturing hub, India needs to move towards better network and fast-paced network to support the movement of logistics  Often it is said- roads are the true mirror of the economy as India is moving from highways to expressways it needs to sustain these changes so that shortly you have infrastructures ready to move ahead in leaps and bounds. Therefore, to enable macroeconomic stabilization through the expansion of revenue expenditure, ring-fencing of capital expenditure levels as a share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) becomes critical. Of course, any number of variables could impact these projections of 2035, from financial recessions to wars, food securities to pandemics, and political uncertainty to rapid urbanization and technological advances. But one thing’s certain— it is in these coming decades, cities are where many of these factors will converge and play out on the world stage.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  “Society can exist without Marketing, but Marketing cannot exist without Society.” Marketing is the management process of anticipating, identifying, and satisfying customers’ requirements. The various conventional marketing tools are advertising, branding, direct marketing, sales promotion, publicity, and public relations. Critics acknowledge that marketing has legitimate uses in as much as it connects goods and services to consumers who desire them. However, some aspects of marketing, especially promotion and advertisements, are subject to criticism. They argue that product promotion is an attempt by the goods and service providers to influence demand. Advertising has become such an inextricable part of our lives that one cannot imagine life without it. Although we hardly ever notice, advertisements leave an indelible mark on our minds, especially on vulnerable groups like children and adolescents.   The commensuration of the two words raises eyebrows in marketing and society, as it is highly debatable. On the one hand, Society thrives on Companies’ marketing efforts, while another school of thought argues that marketing makes society more materialistic. Today, striking a balance between the two is the challenge marketers face. Ethical expectations are a vital part of the business environment. Society expects businesses to be honest and desires corporate executives, at all levels, to apply ethical principles- in other words, guidelines as to what is right and wrong, fair and unfair, and morally correct- when they make business decisions. For better or worse, marketing is everywhere, with the allure of new products, big promises, and hope for something new or different. As we turn on the television or scroll through social media feeds, we will find it hard to avoid someone trying to sell us something. While advertising and marketing share information and tell us what is new, it does so to persuade rather than educate, so their influence can sometimes be more harmful than positive.   The debate about the positives and negatives of advertising is a bit like the infamous chicken or egg question. Some people claim that marketing causes adverse effects, while others argue that it merely reflects what is already happening in the culture. For all the positive potential of marketing, the reality is that it frequently influences society in negative ways. One negative aspect of marketing is its potential to feed into unrealistic expectations, breed discontentment, and influence our thought processes in ways beyond our control. Materialism, workaholism, unhealthy lifestyle habits, alcoholism, politics, and unrealistic views negatively shape our culture and impact the most vulnerable.   According to research, marketing has become increasingly hostile in the modern television era. Consumers are often disturbed by advertisements & marketing, and negative campaign ads tend to fuel a vicious cycle where both sides fling ads back and forth in a futile, narcissistic, tantrum-like attempt to make their opponents look worse and worse while making themselves look better. Marketing aims to present a product in the best light possible. There is some leeway in the creative process. The problem arises when dramatization crosses the line into falsely representing a product. Hefty fines can result from false advertising when levied by the authorities. Marketing and advertising are ingrained in the modern culture, from children’s programs on Saturday mornings to talk shows and prime-time TV. Advertising even invades movies through product placement. Marketing influences how people feel about themselves and often turns out negative. Widespread concern exists about the potential effects of media portrayals of drinking, alcohol product placements, and alcohol advertising on alcohol consumption and problems among young people. Television, radio, film, and popular music are often identified as potential sources through which young people learn about alcohol and as possible influences on young people’s drinking and drinking problems. Even though campaign advertising has been a part of politics,21, scholars are still conflicted over the effects of different advertising strategies. As a result, the literature on political advertising is vast and multifaceted. Conventional wisdom holds that political advertising, in general, is harmful to democracy. Further, the adverse effects of advertising on teenagers include increased cigarette and alcohol use, obesity, poor nutrition, and eating disorders, according to Pediatrics, the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Advertisers are traditionally using techniques to which children and adolescents are more susceptible, such as product placement in TV shows and tie-ins between movies and fast-food restaurants, to mention a few. It’s all kid’s play anyway, with today’s youngsters having profound influence over purchases in all product categories. Many marketing evils lure people into buying even when not required. However, the picture of the relationship between marketing and society is contested. Marketing has often been criticized for encouraging excessive consumption, self-indulgent lifestyle, and producing a consumer culture where products and services are the core of social identity at the expense of other ‘traditional’ values.   Just as in an underdeveloped economy, marketing can be an avenue for publicity of indigenous products and services, thereby generating income; similarly, in developing and developed economies, where competition for the share of the customer’s pocket is high, marketing can lead to attitudinal and lifestyle changes and problems. Free collectible coupons or tattoos inside chips packets, and other such advertising gimmicks and tactics do not add any value to the product being offered but only lure consumers into buying a product they otherwise may not have purchased- leading to another group of people who entice these students to enroll for a weight reduction program! Sex is used in commercials to sell everything from beer to shampoo to cars. New research shows that teenagers’ exposure to sexual content in the media may be responsible for the earlier onset of sexual intercourse or other sexual activities leading to an increased number of HIV-positive cases. Alcohol producers spend $ 5.7 billion/per year on advertising and promotions. Research has found that adolescent drinkers are more likely to have been exposed to alcohol advertising. Studies confirm a direct link between junk food advertisements and obesity among adolescents. As we move ahead with technology and change the marketing strategy with the growing consumerism, it is vital to be cautious. Our cautiousness can only decide what happens in the future regarding marketing.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.   Advertising allows companies to differentiate themselves and highlight their unique selling points.  According to research, the advertisement can increase the market value. Not only offline advertisement, but the world is also going through “Digital advertising” through “social media and many other media’’. With the help of advertising, most people are becoming famous and getting success in their companies.    Advertisements can help the company to grow successfully and potentially. For small to big companies advertisement is the only weapon to change the company’s faith and bring success to the company. Nowadays most of them are using digital media for their advertisement and they’re attracting people to their products. It is a flat form for the people to know what product that they launch by the company, and most of them are using social media like “youtube, Facebook, Twitter Now recently Instagram also sponsoring the advertisements while scrolling through the app”. while coming to “nondigital advertising means firstly it will be the Radio, later pamphlets, and newspaper advertisements, announcing through the mike and roaming on the road”, With these the advertisement can help in growing the market value.  According to research advertisement can helps increases the market value. A recent study that advertisement will only be the “strongest weapon to the change the market value”. Not only does the advertisement increase the market’s value, it sometimes depends upon the product. with the help of this, it will increase the market value of the company and increases the share value of the company.  Most companies are spending crores and lakhs on their advertisement for increasing the market value and their company value.      Presently the following days “celebrities are sponsoring the product and it is a key to the company to increase the market value of the company”. By sponsoring the about their fans buying that product and increasing the market value of the company.  Mostly the main reason for increasing the market value is to show up their product’s specialty and the importance of the product.     By giving advertisements some of them believe it is a brand that can now beat the product. And most people think that and buy that product and this is the one type of way that increases the market value of the product. Some of them trust their product and buy their product, and increase the market value. Nowadays advertising is largely expanded through the public area, the internet websites, etc …By advertising, you can know what the product is launched and what is the specialty of their product, after research, the product will be sold in the market with their values and it will help in increase the market value.   From the above data, we can see how many ways that increase the market value. And so many ways that advertisement is only the way that increases the market value. Not only non-digital media even in the events they’re giving the pamphlets and increasing their market values. And some of them observe that the company’s interaction with the people can also increase the market value of the company. And many of them observe that the quality of their product also increase the market value Blackcoffer Insights 45: D.V.M.S.VIGNESH, GMR INSTITUE OF TECHONOLOGY ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  The human race is known to come up with inventions that decide its future. Many scholars believe that Artificial Intelligence(AI) has been the most pioneering innovation since early humans discovered fire and invented the wheel. The advancement of groundbreaking technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) have constantly been shaping the future of humankind. The likes of Mark Zuckerberg have welcomed the evolution of AI. He once stated- “With A.I. especially, I am optimistic“. While according to Elon Musk, “AI can outsmart and endanger us.” However, we simply cannot ignore how useful and influential AI is in our daily lives. The applications of AI and ML have delved deeply into various domains. The least to mention are Healthcare, Transportation, Education, Media, Communication, Manufacturing, and Customer service. Businesses worldwide are placing a significant emphasis on enhancing their customers’ overall experiences. As a result of AI, a massive leap in customer experience service has come up with the evolution of chatbots. What is a chatbot, and how is it useful in business? Chatbots are AI-based systems used by businesses for communication with customers. Customers can interact with chatbots directly via chat and voice applications. Numerous online customer service platforms are utilizing chatbots to manage bulk phone calls, FAQs, and other common customer service inquiries. Chatbots resolve customer queries within no time and are accessible 24X7, enhancing the customer experience. The use of technologies such as AI, ML, and NLP (Natural Language Processing), enables the bot to analyze and identify the user’s problems and instantly give the most relevant answers to the queries. Platforms such as Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Discord, and Slack have been extensively using chatbots for better communication. Advantages of using chatbots and their impact on customer support There are numerous advantages of using chatbots in businesses- Chatbots can communicate with multiple customers at once. They can be used to send regular updates about the products and exclusive offers by the company. They are available throughout the day, which is crucial for businesses that expand globally in different time zones. It becomes too cumbersome for businesses to have customer care support centers at various locations across the world. There is no human intervention involved. Therefore, chatbots can be accessed worldwide anytime. Chatbots reply instantly, and hence it increases customer engagement. Chatbots can also be extensively used to collect user data and analyze it further to provide customized solutions. ML-based chatbot systems are learning from past conversations to generate more thoughtful replies. Roughly 40 % of internet users around the globe prefer interacting with chatbots rather than virtual agents. With leading sectors such as retail and healthcare rapidly turning towards digital technology, chatbots will continue to grow in popularity in the years to come. Chatbot Market Trends and forecast about its impact on customer support by 2040 According to some reports, it is anticipated that the size of the global chatbot market will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 26% from the years 2022 to 2030. In the year 2021, the chatbot market size was valued at a total of USD 525 million. It is anticipated that the growing adoption of customer service activities among enterprises to reduce operating costs will be the primary factor driving the chatbot market. In the past few years, some of the most significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been in the areas of perception and cognition. Although there is much room for improvement in voice recognition technology, the tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Google have all made significant strides in this direction with their digital assistants Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, respectively. Deep learning systems are now actively utilized to decide trades accomplished on Wall Street and predict whether users will click on particular advertisements. It has increased efficiency on both the consumer and the business side of things. Chatbots can help businesses save money by generating revenue, conducting research, generating leads, and increasing brand awareness. Other uses for chatbots include research and lead generation. Given the trends of the data, we can expect the chatbot industry to surpass the billion-dollar mark in a few years. Hence, by 2040 the chatbot industry would be having a multi-billion dollar market value. How are companies utilizing chatbots to provide superior support for their customers- A comprehensive analysis that provides deep insights into the future of customer service in 2040. Bank of America is responsible for creating one of the most groundbreaking innovations. The recently introduced “Erica” is intended to assist customers in making more informed choices regarding their finances. Customers can make payments, check their balances, save money, and transfer funds with this chatbot, which uses artificial intelligence, algorithms, and predictive messaging. Erica makes it possible for users to interact via text and voice, and it then uses the information provided to push insights to the customer. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is another company incorporating chatbots into their customer service channel. KLM increased the number of customer interactions with the Facebook messenger app by forty percent. The airline wanted to facilitate more effortless conversations between its employees and passengers without compromising passengers’ right to personal privacy. KLM was aware that its customers spent a significant amount of time using Facebook and Messenger, so the company decided to implement a chatbot as its platform for customer service. Messenger is now the channel through which customers can directly receive booking details, boarding passes, and flight status updates. On a typical day,17, KLM receives an average of five messages per minute through Facebook Messenger. During peak traffic, that number jumps to over eleven messages per minute. These innovations with chatbots will surely pave the way for the future. by 2040, chatbots will completely revolutionize the customer experience domain. Challenges ahead There are apparent constraints with AI technology. The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI-driven chatbots are used with customers, even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers. The availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer’s data is also a key challenge. Conclusion Even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function, there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi-folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML-based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  When we talk about AI, different people have different perspectives about it. There is one group of people, having good knowledge about the real potential of AI, who believe that AI can be a novel solution to many problems that the world is facing today. There is another group of people who are merely threatened by the thought of AI taking over the world. The field of AI took birth when Alan Turing in 1950 had this thought “Can machines think?”. Later in the 1980s, with the adoption of “expert systems” by the companies around the world, the booming of the field of AI was initiated. Initially, it was a matter of awe for everyone to see the results of what AI can achieve. AI’s growth in the past few decades has been exponential and it has transformed the way we live, work and solve challenges. AI has made its impact in a wide variety of areas including healthcare, education, business and many more. But, one of the areas of highest impact that AI has made recently is in the environment and climate change. Is AI Revolutionizing the way we deal with Environment and Climate Change? AI can strengthen climate predictions, enable smarter decision-making for decarbonising industries from building to transport, and work out how to allocate renewable energy. In recent years, AI has been a game-changer in how many people, as well as organizations, deal with climate change. Microsoft believes that artificial intelligence, often encompassing machine learning and deep learning, is a “game-changer” for climate change and environmental issues. The company’s ‘AI for Earth’ program has committed $50 million over five years to create and test new applications for AI. AI is increasingly used to manage the intermittency of renewable energy so that more can be incorporated into the grid; it can handle power fluctuations and improve energy storage as well. Wind companies are using AI to get each turbine’s propeller to produce more electricity per rotation by incorporating real-time weather and operational data. AI can also improve energy efficiency on the city scale by incorporating data from smart meters and the Internet of Things (the internet of computing devices that are embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data) to forecast energy demand. Besides, artificial intelligence systems can simulate potential zoning laws, building ordinances, and flood plains to help with urban planning and disaster preparedness. One vision for a sustainable city is to create an “urban dashboard” consisting of real-time data on energy and water use and availability, traffic and weather to make cities more energy-efficient and livable. Hotter temperatures will have significant impacts on agriculture as well. Data from sensors in the field that monitor crop moisture, soil composition and temperature help AI improve production and know when crops need watering. Incorporating this information with that from drones, which are also used to monitor conditions, can help increasingly automatic AI systems know the best times to plant, spray and harvest crops, and when to head off diseases and other problems. This will result in increased efficiency, enhanced yields, and lower use of water, fertilizer and pesticides. But, is AI as good as it looks or does it have a downside? When we talk about the effect of AI in the environment and climate, both sides of the coin must be elucidated. So, apart from all the positives discussed above, the usage of AI also has a downside. Last year’s World Economic Forum report showed that while AI can address some of Earth’s environmental challenges, it is important to manage it properly. According to the forum and experts in the field, AI has the potential to accelerate environmental degradation. The use of power-intensive GPUs to run machine learning training has already been cited as contributing to increased C02 emissions. Although AI has been around for about half a century, the question of environmental impact – and other ethical issues – is only arising now because the techniques developed over decades can now be used in combination with an explosion in data and strong computational power. For all the advances enabled by artificial intelligence, from speech recognition to self-driving cars, AI systems consume a lot of power and can generate high volumes of climate-changing carbon emissions. A study last year found that training an off-the-shelf AI language-processing system produced 1,400 pounds of emissions – about the amount produced by flying one person roundtrip between New York and San Francisco. But there are ways to make machine learning cleaner and greener, a movement that has been called “Green AI.” Some algorithms are less power-hungry than others, for example, and many training sessions can be moved to remote locations that get most of their power from renewable sources. The key, however, is for AI developers and companies to know how much their machine learning experiments are spewing and how much those volumes could be reduced. What can be done? To prevent this, the proposition by the World Economic Forum report is that advancements in “safe” AI should be pursued, to ensure that humanity is not developing AI that is harmful to the environment. Specifically, the World Economic Forum said in its report that AI developers “must incorporate the health of the natural environment as a fundamental dimension.” This means safeguarding against models that will demand the consumption of energy or natural resources beyond what is sustainable,70, among other factors. In a sense, all programs need to be designed with the dimension of environmental protection and improvement in mind. In the future development of AI programs, it will also be important to note the environmental impact of creating these systems in the first place. According to an academic study on energy usage for deep learning processes, the creation of an effective AI might be costly to the environment. Nearly 300,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are created during the process of training a single model. This is basically equal to the emissions of five average cars in the United States. Considering the negative environmental impact in addition to the positive implications of AI and climate change will be crucial, moving forward. There is always room for improvement, some pioneers of machine learning recently published a paper called Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning was discussed at a major AI conference. David Rolnick, a postdoctoral fellow of the University of Pennsylvania said “call to arms” which means to bring researchers together. This paper covers thirteen areas of research where machine learning can be used, including energy production, CO2 removal, education, solar geoengineering, finance and many more. The main idea is to build more energy-efficient buildings, creating new low-carbon materials, high tech monitoring of deforestation and greener transportation sources. Artificial intelligence and machine learning can be a medium but the real work is to be done by us as a caretaker of mother earth. How about better forecasting of climate change?  The kick start was already done by climate informatics in 2011 which regulates the collaboration of data science and climate science. It covers a wide range of topics like improving prediction of extreme events such as hurricanes, paleoclimatology, collecting data from ice cores, climate up-down scaling and its impact on us. “There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Monteleoni Claire Monteleoni, a computer science professor at the University of Colorado concludes that AI/ ML models generally forecast for the short-term. There is a significant difference when it comes to long-term forecasting. The first system was developed at Princeton in the 1960s. All the AI/ ML models developed till now revolve around atmosphere, oceans, land, cryosphere or ice. AI can help to achieve new heights with the amount of data collected at this point of time, and compute more complex climate conditions using climate modeling algorithms. What about showing the effects of extreme weather? We all know that climate change is real and the rise in atmospheric temperature the proof, but to make it more realistic, Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms (MILA), Microsoft and ConscientAI Labs uses Generative Adversarial Networks popularly know as GANs to simulate what mother earth will look like with the rising sea levels, atmospheric temperature, air pollution and intensive storms. “Our goal is not to convince people climate change is real, it’s to get people who do believe it is real to do more about that,” said Victor Schmidt, a co-author of the paper and Ph.D. candidate at MILA The project is deployed for the people to look at what their places will look like in the future when there will be a significant climate change. Can we track carbon emissions? Short answer, yes. Tracking of carbon emission is one of the agendas of the UN. For this year 2020, the UN’s goal is to prevent new coal plants from being built. Satellite images come into picture using deep learning techniques, data science researchers can analyze these high quality satellite images and track the emission. Google is expanding its horizon of nonprofit’s satellite imagery, including gas-powered plants emissions which can be used by researchers to track the pollution. There are countries organizations which govern CO2 emission on the ground level but these data are unreachable by global monitoring associations. AI can automate the analysis of images of power plants to get regular updates on emissions. It also introduces new ways to measure a plant’s impact, by crunching numbers of nearby infrastructure and electricity use. That’s beneficial for gas-powered plants that don’t have the easy-to-measure plumes that coal-powered plants have.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  We’ve really done it this year. Like an insatiable glutton, the law of averages has come home to roost. We should’ve taken the hint when on the 1st of January, 66 people lost their lives in the Jakarta floods. What followed was like the highlights reel of a disaster movie franchise – a volcanic eruption in The Philippines, irrepressible bushfires in Australia, earthquakes in Russia, Iran, Turkey, India, and China. And speaking of China. 2020 has brought home the fragile mortality of the human race into sharp focus. As global Covid-19 deaths stoutly push past the grim 1 million marks, we have no choice but to question our place in the universe – are we the all-conquering masters of our domain, or mere tourists in a ruthlessly apathetic ecosystem? Is the human race on the ubiquitous three-part literary arc that defines every story, every life, every civilization – ascent, apex, and descent? Maybe when Michael Jackson unveiled his moonwalk in 1983, or when Barack Obama stepped into the White House as President of the United States in 2008, or indeed when MS Dhoni lifted the Cricket World Cup in 2011, we peaked, as a species, and everything since then has been a steady unraveling. 500 years is a long time. For context, the world population in 1500 AD was a mere 461 million. The 16-fold explosion since then is unprecedented in history, but we might just be at the tip of an iceberg. Though fertility rates are dropping and more and more people are foregoing the chance to have babies, we might just have crossed the threshold – the population projections for the year 2050 is 9.8 billion, and for 2100 is a whopping 11.2 billion1. Somewhere out there, Malthus is cackling in his grave. The year 2500 suddenly seems a long way off, and this conversation seems ever-more pertinent today. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists is not optimistic – the famed Doomsday Clock they maintain is the closest to ‘midnight’ (our proximity to global catastrophe), since its inception in 1947. Global warming? Check. The threat of nuclear war? Check. Ongoing pandemic? Check, check, check. And yet, hope floats, for three reasons. Mankind may just have its back to the wall right now, but there are three shoots of potential that might just help us make it to 2500 AD – the advent of a basket of disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, bio-enhancement, genetic engineering), the private sector focus on space exploration and terraforming, and good old fashioned human resilience. While the first two factors will no doubt be critical to human survival, it is the third one that we must pin our hopes on – our long-demonstrated history of surviving whatever nature, the universe, or our own self-destructive tendency, throws our way. The Next Superman? In the 13th century, in the Italian town of Pisa, an enterprising tinkerer developed the first eyeglasses, for a local friar with weakening eyesight2. All of a sudden, there existed an external device that could amplify our senses, a tool that gave us an advantage in survival. Today, LASIK surgeries obviate the need for eyeglasses entirely. Hearing aids give the gift of auditory perception back to those who had gotten used to a world of muffled voices and unheard sounds. The iPhone routinely comes with an augmented reality tool that allows us to measure the length of objects in front of us. But the real science starts where the imagination ends – augmented reality glasses, smart wearables, and virtual reality tools will be ubiquitous in the next few decades. But what after that? Science has the answer, and it’s both thrilling and scary. Artificial intelligence has become the stuff of fable,66, the filler for all questions left unanswered. But AI, combined with bio-enhancement and genetic engineering, might just lead to the evolution of what some are calling Homo nouveau3. Homo nouveau will be smarter, faster, more agile, and better equipped to adapt to what promises to be a world that is VUCA beyond our imaginations. What might such a human being look like? They might have a small chip embedded in their brain that utilizes artificial intelligence for enhanced sensory perception. What does that mean? It means that they would be able to see better, focuses their attention for longer, hears what they want to hear, and communicate the appropriate reaction to the rest of the body. Through a chemical in the blood, this AI chip would be able to demand the appropriate response from the body. Bio-augmentation of limbs and organs, internal and external, would mean that what a person can or cannot do is no longer determined at birth, but can simply be bought. All of a sudden, the average Joe can run faster than Usain Bolt, swim better than Michael Phelps, and…fly? Maybe. Genetic engineering will be the missing link. Already there are feverish conversations about a dystopian future featuring designer babies and a digital divide that simply cannot be overcome because it is inbuilt into one’s DNA. The breakthrough with CRISPR-Cas9 might just be the key to unlock the mysteries of DNA manipulation. So what if there’s no food left? Our body AI will adjust our appetite accordingly. No water? Absorb humidity from the air through specialized pores in the skin. The human being in 2500 AD may not be how we recognize one today. That may be our only shot. Galactic Dominance SpaceX, led by its mercurial leader Elon Musk, has been the leader here. The SpaceX Mars Programme is based on a very simple premise – as the earth’s closest planet in terms of distance and terrestrial conditions, Mars would be our best bet for colonization. Musk has invested billions of dollars in the Mars Space Programme and remains a fervent believer in the concept. And among tech visionaries, Musk is not alone. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, owns Blue Origin, which simply aims to make spaceflight cheaper through incremental technological growth. Bezos, who took an online retailer of books and turned it into an ever-expanding behemoth, is not a man who thinks small. With more and more business leaders finding spaceflight and planetary colonization a tantalizing prospect, there will inevitably be a concerted push to developing an actual colony on another planet. And when the pull-factor to this development starts hitting diminishing returns, there will be the inevitable push factor as global warming and the possible increase in the eruption of pandemics begin to take their toll. It might just become a more feasible option for people to find an alternate home, if not on Mars, then on one of Saturn’s moons. A human colony on Mars sounds like a concept straight out of science fiction, but so did a permanent station in Antarctica until a few decades ago. Mount Everest seemed like an unapproachable summit until someone went ahead and planted a flag at the peak. Today, hundreds of people every year attempt the climb. As spaceflight becomes more reasonable, as the urge to explore supersedes the inertia of investment, we become closer to our best chance of survival – leaving planet earth behind and finding another home, perhaps one more forgiving of our follies. The Human Spirit The introduction to this article includes an illustrative list of disasters and misfortunes that have struck the global community this year. And yet, we survive. Businesses surge ahead, people adapt to a world of masks and social distancing, the world goes on. Earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, we’ve seen them all before and survived, and the human race, in its intrepid exploration of the world, pushes onward and upward. Technological visionaries envision a future that the rest of us cannot see, and then invest money in their vision. Gradually, what seemed unthinkable suddenly becomes real – the moon landing is the best possible example of that. Google launched Google Glass as the first augmented reality wearable technology, and suddenly we could foresee a future with smart eyewear. While the product didn’t quite catch on, that doesn’t mean other companies aren’t trying. Bio-augmentation is already a fast-developing industry, while CRISPR-Cas9, the “genetic scissors” is being held back only by regulatory bottlenecks. How long before the prospect of fiddling with the gene code becomes not a luxury but a necessity? The human spirit, the tendency to survive and thrive at all costs, will eventually win. The human race will survive to 2500, of that there is no doubt. The real question is, will the person who exists in 2500, with bionic chips and a bio-enhanced body structure and a modified genetic code, be called a Homo sapien? Or is Homo nouveau the way forward?

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  The word “leadership” can bring to mind a variety of images. For example, A political leader, pursuing a passionate, personal cause or An executive, developing his/her company’s strategy to beat the competition. Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things. They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new. Leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to “win” as a team or an organization; and it is dynamic, exciting, and inspiring. In my point of view we cannot become a good leader without technical expertise because every task in the organization it’s required a lot of skills, knowledge, consistent, enthusiastic, patience, motivating, inspiring, industrious, and critical thinking on the basis of the field we are doing. A leader should have the ability to motivate self and others, effective oral and written communication, critical thinking skills at the working team and delegating a task. Good leaders do have these abilities and if we wanted to create a future leader. They need to take in a large volume of information and to take the essential elements that define the core problem to solve. They need to organize a team to solve these problems and to communicate to a group, they need to established trust with a group and use the trust to allow the team to accomplish the work more than it could be done alone. Though all these skills we have but it’s would not sufficient to make us a great leader because to excel and utilize these abilities in practice we need a lot of technical expertise in a particular domain. For example, Like in a hospital if the head of the hospital is lead by other people rather than Doctor then the hospital would become worse at a point because the person from other fields he could not lead and understand the real scenario and mechanism that the hospital is functioning and he would not understand the staff and the patient as well. Hence, to lead the hospital Doctor is deserved who knows his own field how to lead and understand the real scenario of it. That’s why being a leader requires technical expertise to have great knowledge and understanding about his own organization. Every person if they want to become a leader they should have technical expertise on their own organization so that their organization would run smoothly, hence nobody could run other organization if we do not have the technical expertise on that field. So, be a leader, not a boss which makes your life much better, as they’re a saying that “ A good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better.” Blackcoffer Insights 20: Caldinus Nongrang, NIT Meghalaya ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  Have you ever wondered what’s common between Sir Alex Ferguson, Pep Guardiola, and Jose Mourinho? I know it might look a lame question, especially to the ardent football followers. At first instinct, the answer is that they are regarded as the top managers in the football universe. #UCLwinners. But when given a closer look, these managers, weren’t that great when it came to their careers as football players. Any naïve observer can build a fallacy of causation and correlation that those who don’t have a great career as a football player will go on to become a great football manager. But is this restricted just to football? Mike Brearley, one of the greatest captains in the history of cricket and the author of the book the art of captaincy, wasn’t the prolific batsman of his time. Our former President, A P J Abdul Kalam didn’t have a political background, but was still appointed as the president of our country and went to become one of the finest presidents our country has ever had. So, can it be stated with confidence that great leaders need not be the expert in their respective fields?Let’s understand the leadership role, types of leaders, and explore a few more perspectives before we arrive at a conclusion.  Let’s start by first understanding what or who is a leader. A leader is not a position or a designation. It’s a virtue if employed correctly. From a janitor to the CEO, from a student to a researcher, from a content writer to a philosopher everybody is a leader. (#leadersareeverywhere) So, what are the virtues of a leader? One of the famous personality trait theories, the Big 5 personality trait theory is always linked closely with leadership. As per the various researches, the personality traits of extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness are associated with leaders more often than the other two traits. Not just these humble and empathetic are also considered as the adjectives that are frequently associated with leaders. But nowhere is technical expertise related to a leader. #NOTSOTECHNICAL As stated by Colin Powell Leadership is the art of accomplishing more than the science of management says is possible. #It’sART If leadership is an art and leaders are the artists then more or less the leaders can be viewed as directors of the films who are organizing, arranging, managing, and directing the scenes. Another analogy for that can be the orchestra where the conductor is using the baton/stick to set the rhythm of the band. So, is it necessary for the conductor to himself or herself by a great violinist? No. When it comes to the corporate sector the leader need not be an expert on the technology but should know how the technology functions so that he/she can utilize it in the best possible way. They can allocate the task of building technology to the right technical experts. And how do the leaders identify the right person for that job? Or how do leaders know what qualities to look for in a person? #Experience. Every great leader once started off as one of the frontline workers or at the bottom of the pyramid in the hierarchical structure. Even though they might not have had the technical expertise in their respective fields, their visionary outlook, their management skills, and the experience they gathered helped them in achieving their targets. Leaders can always take the assistance of the subject matter experts to guide them in situations of technical difficulties. As per the great man, situational and trait theory of leadership, leadership is innate to the person. Leadership though can be conditioned or can be brought out in a person by rewarding him, great leaders show unconditional attachment towards their vision. Everyone knows how to read a map, but which path to choose isn’t something that can be taught. Leaders give the direction or vision to the company and drive it closer to the target that the company wants to achieve. Leadership theories don’t focus on the technical knowledge of the leaders, but rather more on people skills, their approach towards a problem, and how well they guide and hire others to get the job done, which is also evident as per the managerial skills required as per Robert Katz.  Though it can be argued that technical experts are also the great leaders in their areas, but these leaders are generally at the middle management level. As per the different leadership styles, a servant leader is the one who always tries to achieve the goal of the team. These leaders are the ones who have a management objective laid out in front of them and they drive the team closer to achieving the target by having the people-first mindset, a collaborative approach towards solving the problem. These are the people or the leaders needed at the execution level of the project or those who are too close to the employees at the bottom-most level. Since the managers at the top of the pyramid don’t get much time to invest in people they appoint the right people on their behalf to get the job done.   Consider an IT firm. So as per the points mentioned above, does it mean that a leader or the manager shouldn’t know how to code? Depends. If the person is the first line manager then he or she should probably know how to code so that he or she can help the team in achieving the target of producing less garbage which might be one of the project’s KPIs. The project manager, who might be an operations manager, (#MBA) from an IT background, probably need not know what line of code is to be written but should know the algorithms or the logic behind the code so that he or she can validate the code from the client’s perspective. The CEO, might not be from an IT background but should know how to run an IT firm rather than the syntax of the code. But in today’s competitive world leaders can’t be one dimensional. They need to have expertise in multiple areas to be at the top. Mike Brearley if got a chance to play a T20 match, won’t even get picked into aside, not because of his age, but because of his not so great looking batting statistics(#Thegamehaschanged). His leadership skills won’t be enough to get him into the squad. But he can be a great leader if selected to coach the top 15 captains in the world today. As we have already discussed the film directors, their job isn’t to teach the cameramen on how to set up or operate (lens settings, etc) the camera. Their job is to guide the cameramen on what angle it should be held and how he or she should coordinate with the lights crew so that a perfect shot is captured. So even if a leader may not be a technical expert of his field,68, but if he or she has the right approach and mindset, understands the system and its process, then he or she can hire the best talent for the job and can get the work done by guiding the talent, with his or her vision.  So, the answer to the question, which we came across in the first paragraph, is yes and no. Depending upon the position in the hierarchy (yes for a front-line manager and no for a CXO) and the type of the leader you are, the level of technical expertise needed varies. Though as stated earlier by Robert Katz, the CXO’s need to have the least amount of technical expertise, the CXO should know how the technology functions or what are the applications. What processes are to be followed to build the technology.  He or she should now what is to be done rather than how it is to be done, (#itsnothowitswhat). Otherwise, even though the company might be sitting on a gold mine but If the leader isn’t aware of that or isn’t learned enough to know what to do with it, no company can succeed even with having all the resources at their disposal. Leaders command respect and don’t demand it and that’s possible when they give value to their front-line employees, seek timely advice from the technical experts, and put the resources to the best of its uses. Otherwise, you will be surrounded by technical experts like dilberts.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  Brief  The Financial Crisis of 2008 started as a crisis in the subprime mortgage market (i.e. in a market where lending of loans is done to people who may have difficulty in maintaining the repayment schedule or in simple terms, loans were given out to people without proper checks and low credit scores) which ultimately led onto a huge global collapse. The Financial Crisis of 2008 or Great Recession is considered the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Financial Crisis Explained – In the year 1996, there was a dot-com boom (or otherwise known as the dot com bubble) in the United States, a period of massive growth in the use of the internet because of which the stock market prices started increasing rapidly. However, around the year 2000, it dropped which led people and investors to withdraw their investments from the stock market rapidly. It led to the decline of the price of shares in stock markets and the interest rate plummeted to around 1% very quickly in a short span. Investors were now looking for a brighter option than investing in stock markets.   Fig – Rise and fall of the Dot Com Bubble As interest rates went lower and lower, real estate prices started rising and the US Govt also encouraged people to buy houses and properties. The demand for the same started rising rapidly and investors now found a great option to invest in (i.e. in Real Estate). During that same time, Investment Banks saw an opportunity, chimed in and started buying loans from Banks in bulk and clubbed multiple loans under a complex derivative called CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligations) and started providing it to these Investors after getting a credit rating of “AAA” (Very Safe Investment) from the Credit Rating Agencies. Investors naturally fell for it and started buying these CDOs. So now, the risk factor of these loans got transferred from the Banks to the Investment Banks and then again to the CDO Investors. With the high buying demand of CDOs, Investment banks started demanding or pressurizing Banks to provide even more Loans so that they can provide more CDOs to the Investors. However, Banks had already provided loans to people with good credit history and regular income people. But in the hope of getting even more credit from Investment Banks, these same banks then started giving out subprime housing loans to people with low credit scores.Approximately $174Bn worth of loans were given out during the period 2000-2007 and most of them were clubbed as CDOs with a “AAA” rating from the Credit Rating Agencies. Approximately 70% of these CDO’s were marked with a “AAA” rating. Investment Banks and Credit Rating Agencies were now enjoying large profits during this time. Moody’s (a credit rating agency) profits increased 4x times during that period (2000-2007). Looking at the huge profits being made by the Investment Banks and Credit Rating Agencies, Insurance companies (like AIG) now started giving out insurance on these CDOs to the investors and they called it CDS (Credit Default Swap). AIG believed that since the CDOs were rated as “AAA” (Very Safe Investment), the failure chances of these CDOs were very minimal. They misjudged or were unaware of the fact that some of the loans that were clubbed under these CDOs were Sub Prime loans. Now CDO Investors started buying out CDS from AIG and other companies to safeguard and protect them from any losses. AIG then started making huge profits because of the premiums that the investors had to pay. But they never realized the outcome if by any chance the CDOs fail at some point in time. Thus, the risk factor again got transferred from the CDO investors to the Insurance Companies.  Fig – Flow Diagram showing how the Risk Factors got transferred Coming to the loan borrowers now, Sub Prime Borrowers from banks were unaware of the fact of Adjustable Rate Loans (interest rate of these loans keeps changing) and thus had to pay lower interests at the start but more interest rates later on. The borrowers started defaulting on these loans when the interest rates increased dramatically around 2007 and thus banks had to then resell those houses to make up for the loans defaulted.  Added to the problem was the fact that borrowers were not spending any amount of money from their pockets while taking loans and banks were providing the full amount of loans. Almost 50% of the borrowers did not pay anything from their own pocket and bought the home only using the housing loan. This led to a huge increase in the defaulters of borrowers and ultimately banks had to auction houses to gain credit back. With the high-interest rates and no one to buy the auctioned houses, this ultimately caused a chain reaction and banks were no longer receiving credit. The prices of Real Estate started falling drastically and people with good credit scores who had earlier taken housing loans also started defaulting because the price of their houses/homes fell below the loan amount that they had taken earlier. Banks stopped receiving money and also because of this chain reaction, the value of CDOs ultimately came down to 0. Some Investors went for huge losses and few Investment companies went bankrupt (ex – Lehman Brothers). Moreover, insurance companies had to pay back those investors who had taken insurance. As a result, some of the insurance companies also went bankrupt. AIG too almost lost about $100Bn in paying back the investors who had earlier insured their CDOs. However, the US Govt. finally decided to bail out AIG in order to save them from going bankrupt. CDOs and CDSs were not regulated during that time by the Federal Reserve and thus this whole situation ultimately led to credit crunch (became very difficult to get loans) and the whole economy of the US underwent a crisis that led to a global impact all around the world.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  Mr. Sakamoto is a bonsai artist, lives downtown Kyoto, Japan. Bonsai is a Japanese art form that is the cultivation of small trees in a small or medium container. He is in this field of business for the last ten years and he loves what he does on a daily basis. People from different cities in Japan, come to buy his artwork. But, in the early stage of his business, he was just another regular Bosai artist. His popularity has increased because of the stories he tells for every art he is selling. His customer immediately loved him for this while buying A Bonsai art. He loved to sell his customer with his artwork and a story related to that product which resurrects his presence through his art in customers. Soon enough his business thrived and nowadays he is always busy. After the digital revolution, although his sales increased, he was not happy. He was not satisfied. Something is eating up his mind day by day. He could not understand what’s the reason behind his remorse. A chatbot is an awesome invention of the digital revolution. It is the real-life embodiment of Customer Engagement. Every business needs this feature- will be an understatement. Because Customer engagement is the base of any business. The chatbot does the exact thing digitally. It helps customers to answer the queries and tell about the product that the business has to offer is a fully automated way with vibrant customizations.              Mr. Sakamoto is running his business for the last fifteen years now. And now he is happy that he was not for the past couple of years. The rationale behind his happiness is the chatbot. Though he has a website and app to sell his Bonsai art, he could not engage with the customers in the way he wanted to. He has trained his employees and apprentices, but they are not providing the same service in the way he does. He was unsatisfied and the chatbot relives him from his sadness. He has done all that at affordable prices in no time. Let’s understand the Mr. Sakamoto’s “Mondai Nai”- perspective about why chatbot is the answer of his problems. Building the Trust with Customers This is the fundamental and root cause for which Mr. Sakamoto has to implement the chatbot in the first place. His stories are embedded with each art. The product which he sells needs this story to be with it. His stories which were not been told to all the customers before are now sharing with this chatbot and building the trust between them. We all can agree on this one statement that trust is the most impactful aspect, maybe the best of aspects, in the relation between any customer and business-owner, whether the business is small, medium, or large. Target the Millennial Customer Millennials, a word that was not introduced before 1990. The generation which is stuck in between Gen-x and Gen-y. A generation of people accustomed to both digitization and old culture. They are the most targeted audience in this era. What else would be more approachable to this generation than a chatbot? It’s easy, less time consuming to use. Mr. Sakamoto is now one of the few Gen-x persons who can do business with the millennial so easily. Better Human Interactions Mr. Sakamoto has some employees and apprentices. He has trained them as per his needs. But there is a limit. They can’t deliver the exact things that he can or the way he does. Neither chatbot can do that exactly, it will accurately follow the instructions. Not only the chatbot solve the queries of the customer in his way, but also give a recommendation to the product in the way he wants too. Is there any more attribute he would care about that? Absolutely no! 24*7 Service The most expensive thing for any businessman is the return of their customer with an empty hand because of his unavailability. A chatbot is a perfect way to solve it. For Mr. Sakamoto’s customized chatbot is not only present for customers in their availability, but also It was giving the response to the customer in all the time zone, all over the world. Mr. Sakamoto wouldn’t be happier for this feature. Scaling Up Business in Globalization In the era of globalization, what is more, helpful than a chatbot? It can be customized in any language. It can be accessed by any human being residing in any part of the world. And at the end of the day, when that foreigner is happy with the buy and the felicitation and says “Arigato” but in his own language, at that moment he feels so warm and happy. Handling a lot of customers is really hard. He assigned employees, but the rate is growing fast. So, in the competition of the market, Mr. Sakamoto took the help of a chatbot. Now this automated customized application is handling a greater number of customers than his employees can do. His business is growing exponentially. Now, when you found out why Mr. Sakamoto is happy and his business is growing in this competitive industry then, do you still have a question in mind that why does your business need a chatbot?

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  No one can reduce mistakes to zero, but you can learn to harness your drive to prevent them and channel it into better decision making. Use these tips to become a more effective worrier. Don’t be afraid or ashamed of your fear.  Our culture glorifies fearlessness. The traditional image of a leader is one who is smart, tough, and unafraid. But fear, like any emotion, has an evolutionary purpose and upside. Your concern about making mistakes is there to remind you that we’re in a challenging situation. A cautious leader has value. This is especially true in times like these. So don’t get caught up in ruminating: “I shouldn’t be so fearful.” Don’t be ashamed or afraid of your fear of making mistakes and don’t interpret it as evidence that you’re an indecisive leader, or not bold, not visionary. If you have a natural tendency to be prevention-focused, channel it to be bold and visionary! (If you struggle to believe this, identify leaders who have done just that by figuring out how to prevent disasters.) Use emotional agility skills.  Fear of mistakes can paralyze people. Emotional agility skills are an antidote to this paralysis. This process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings, such as “I feel anxious I’m not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe.” Stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them. It’s like turning the light on in a dark room. Next comes accepting reality. For example, “I understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways.” List off every truth you need to accept. Then comes acting your values. Let’s say one of your highest values is conscientiousness. How might that value apply in this situation? For example, it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have. Identify your five most important values related to decision-making in a crisis. Then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face. Repeat this process for each of your fears. It will help you tolerate the fact that we sometimes need to act when the course of action isn’t clear and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to reduce uncertainty to zero. Focus on your processes.  Worrying can help you make better decisions if you do it effectively. Most people don’t. When you worry, it should be solutions-focused, not just perseverating on the presence of a threat. Direct your worry towards behaviors that will realistically reduce the chances of failure. We can control systems, not outcomes. What are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes? Direct your worries into answering questions like these: Is the data you’re relying on reliable? What are the limitations of it? How do your systems help prevent groupthink? What procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots? How do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders? What are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences? Broaden your thinking.  When we’re scared of making a mistake, our thinking can narrow around that particular scenario. Imagine you’re out walking at night. You’re worried about tripping, so you keep looking down at your feet. Next thing you know you’ve walked into a lamp post. Or, imagine the person who is scared of flying. They drive everywhere, even though driving is objectively more dangerous. When you open the aperture, it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there. This can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most. It might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes. But this strategy can help kick you into problem-solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you. A leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing, they don’t realize that other people care most about something else. Find out what other people’s priorities are. Recognize the value of leisure. Fear grabs us. It makes it difficult to direct our attention away. This is how it is designed to work so that we don’t ignore threats. Some people react to fear with extreme hypervigilance. They want to be on guard, at their command post, at all times. This might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to work. That type of adrenalin-fueled behavior can have short-term value, but it can also be myopic. A different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking. We need leisure (and sleep!) to step back, integrate the threads of our thinking, see blindspots, and think creatively. Get some silent time. Although much maligned, a game of golf might be exactly what you need to think about tough problems holistically. Detach from judgment-clouding noise.  As mentioned, when people are fearful they can go into always-on monitoring mode. You may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing, to always be on social media, or check data too frequently. This can result in information overload. Your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down. Recognize if you’re doing this and limit over-monitoring or over checking. Avoid panicked, frenzied behavior. On its own, being afraid of making mistakes doesn’t make you more or less likely to make good decisions. If you worry excessively in a way that focuses only on how bad the experience of stress and uncertainty feels, you might make do or say the wrong things. However, if you understand how anxiety works at a cognitive level, you can use it to motivate careful but bold and well-reasoned choices.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  Marketing can be defined as an act of promotion or advertisement of selling products or services. It is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of the consumers by understanding the target consumer market and particular businesses. It has evolved into a new form especially due to the excessive use of social media. Due to the boost in the use of social media, it is easier for businesses to market and advertise their business or the products and services offered by them. It affects both businesses and consumers in a significant manner. How does marketing influence business? In the words of Peter Drucker: “Because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two–and only two–basic functions: marketing and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs. Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business.” Marketing doesn’t just “impact” a business – it is the function that saves a company from closing down. Marketing has various benefits for business such as – Increasing Opportunities Marketing your business can have a huge impact on new businesses by creating large barriers for them to enter a well-established market. The new companies, brands, and businesses marketing, and advertisement can play a significant in making consumers aware of the products and services they are offering. Sales Assistance While a company can sell out its products to larger customers. With the assistance of various marketing tactics, they can significantly improve their brand awareness and make their product more visible to a larger audience, which in turn increases both sales and revenue. Marketing can help in identifying the buying behavior of consumers as well. Market Awareness Whether you are a new company or an established one, they need to create awareness about their product to boost their sales and revenue. Making use of correct marketing tools can help businesses in reaching out to more customers, therefore, creating awareness about the product.   Strategy Formulation It has a huge impact on the functioning of the business. A business marketing strategy is what you offer, how you offer, and whom you offer. Whenever a company forms a marketing strategy they are thinking about the future success of the business. They make sure that they understand consumer needs, and what they want and they know how to communicate well with the target audience so they understand the offer they are offering.   source- STATE OF MARKETING, 8TH EDITION, SALESFORCE Lead Generation Inbound marketing has immensely modernized the way businesses undertake marketing and selling operations. It greatly helps in creating awareness and spreading the message about the product. Current Marketing Trends Marketing trends are very essential to boost business. Some of the hottest trends in the market which can surely boost the business are –   It means that consumers interact with the brands through chatbots and voice assistants. It is most commonly used in marketing campaigns. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are the reasons behind conversational marketing. In a recent study by IBM, it was found that more than 70% of users want instant answers to their queries. source- STATE OF MARKETING, 8TH EDITION, SALESFORCE This is where conversational marketing can help them reach out to customers effectively and efficiently. It is a powerful way of driving sales and returns on investment (ROI). Brands using this can have a positive impact on their businesses. Influencer Marketing In no sense, influencer marketing has gained significant attraction in the past one to two years. brands use online influencers for their marketing campaigns through social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. It includes influencers creating content by interacting with the product or services offered or with the employee of the business. Influencer marketing yields better results than conventional celebrity endorsements. They can easily interact with their followers which results in better engagement. Influencer marketing plays a significant role in consumer behavior and psychology such as recommendations. In recent times we have seen various brands like beardo, and Muscleblaze use influencers on Instagram to market their product. The influencers create content about the product and services offered which creates an online marketing campaign for the businesses. Highly personalized content experience The content you post can have a significant impact on the development of the business. Personalized content can result in better consumer interaction. Big businesses like Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, etc. are some successful examples. If we take the example of Netflix, it automatically suggests movies and web series on the search history of the user, and the same is done by Spotify. Facebook makes use of an algorithm that determines the kind of content that should be shown on the user’s feed. Amazon makes use of users’ browsing and purchasing history while displaying products when we log in to it. Spotify Wrapped is one of the music streaming service’s most effective content marketing initiatives. Every year, around the New year, Spotify subscribers receive a wonderful compilation of all the songs they’ve listened to. The compilation is presented with graphics in vibrant colors and is divided into genres, years, musicians, and more. Users then have the option to share their wrapped playlists on social media, which is a crucial component that has caused the campaign to trend on social media every year since its beginning.   SOURCE- https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-01/the-wait-is-over-your-spotify-2021-wrapped-is-here/ Adoption of Automation Automation in marketing is making use of technology to automate marketing and advertising efforts. The covid-19 pandemic has significantly increased the use of technology and automation not only in marketing but in other sectors of the business as well. It may sound complex but automation in marketing is simple. Automated email sequences in sales and the upload of social media posts are all examples of Automation in marketing. Marketing automation allows businesses to scale their efforts to reach out to larger customers. More than 30% of business owners claim that marketing automation help with time-saving.  Their marketing team no longer needs to waste time repetitively focusing on tasks and can focus on optimization and content creation. Nissan gathers relevant data about its customers, including the time at which each vehicle was purchased. Six months after the automobile is acquired, they can utilize the purchase date to automatically send a reminder email to schedule the first service visit. This is an essential component of Nissan’s strategy because maintenance costs collected after the sale of the vehicle make up a significant part of Nissan’s overall earnings.   By understanding, consumer behavior marketers can fill in the gap of how consumers buy a product and identify the product that is needed ad the obsolete products. Studying consumer behavior can help marketers to present the product in a way that yields higher consumer attraction. Understanding consumer behavior is the key secret to reaching out to more customers for brand recognition, engaging with the clients, and converting those into potential buyers. How marketing influences consumer decisions? The primary responsibility of a marketing department is to grow the market share by acquiring and keeping new clients. The best way to do that is by monitoring, evaluating, and controlling consumer behavior. Modern marketing strategies easily handle this duty. Let’s examine the how and why in more detail. Constant advertising Regularly held marketing initiatives have a significant impact on consumers’ purchase decisions. They pick one brand over another just because they saw the first one’s advertisement more frequently. Customers tend to trust some businesses more than others simply because they have better blogs, and more visually appealing material and employ opinion leaders who help customers associate with the company favorably. Emotional connection Instead of informing consumers, modern marketing aims to convince and build strong emotional bonds with brands and products. Even if people can’t recall where or when they saw a specific advertisement, they may still experience a specific emotion when they look at a product at a store, such as happiness, comfort, or confidence. It occurs because the advertising they watched caused their brain to detect a particular emotion. The brain immediately connected the product with a certain emotion when they first viewed it. When buyers select from a variety of comparable products from various companies, this relationship will operate flawlessly.   Nike advertises in a way that makes its customers comfortable. Its tagline,19, “Just Do It,” speaks for itself. Allowing everybody and everyone to come up with their meaning of the term makes it straightforward but to the point and helps the business build relationships with its customers. The audience is emotionally connected to this slogan. Setting the scene We believe that each of our social, professional, and informational settings is distinct. But in reality, we all live in a world of marketing where everything is offered for sale and purchased. It’s not good or bad; it’s simply the new commercial reality that dictates what you’ll wear tomorrow, how you’ll address your boss, and how much of your income you’ll spend on eating out. With a few notable exceptions, it is generally applicable to everyone, from a young wealthy nerd who is only 20 years old to a family in their late 30s. If you give it some more thought, you’ll realize that most of the material you encounter each day attempts to sell you something, such as a good, idea, an emotion, a political viewpoint, a way of acting, etc. Marketing strategies and tactics in all their forms and guises are what produce this entire environment.  Setting trends Take, for instance, the blogs of modern businesses. Rather than being sales tools, they appear to be thematic media. Companies work to position themselves as the go-to resource for information about a given industry by disseminating their knowledge of it to consumers. In this approach, they produce a ton of content, including viral material that shapes consumer trends and purchasing patterns. Today, public perception and reputation are even more valuable than actual goods. If it has a worthwhile message to convey and is effectively promoted, even a plain chicken egg can become viral and break Instagram records.   Source-Instagram Because it informs, equalizes, supports, engages, sells, and expands a business’s operations and offers, marketing is crucial for enterprises. It is equally important in the sense that it greatly influences the potential consumer behavior of the individual. If done correctly marketing can create a huge influence on both businesses and consumers.

The Covid-19 crisis and its fallout including recession, layoffs, and uneven economic pain-as well as recent protests over police brutality and demands for racial justice, have presented many of us with challenges that we’ve not encountered before.

Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development.  Gender diversity is an equal representation of all genders in workplaces. One of the most important sectors where there is under-representation of gender diversity is the technological industry. Gender diversity means you have an equal opportunity which is not limited by gender. But, the true reality is gender diversity is a far outcry in the world. Gender diversity isn’t a new topic but an old and global phenomenon and technology industry is not a stranger to it.  Women are often underrepresented in the technology sector. To understand the gap, let’s look at some statistics.  The percentage of women employed across all job sectors in the US has grown to be 47%. Out of 47%. 34% belong to the top 5 technology companies (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft). Women software engineer hires have only increased 2% over the last 20 years 50% of women said they have experienced gender discrimination at work. Only 37% of tech startups have at least one woman on the board of directors. The ratio of men to women in engineering is 5:1. 25.5% of Google’s leaders on a global scale are women.  Even in the tech conference organizations, there were fewer female keynote speakers than male speakers. Eight percent to 17 percent of gay and transgender workers report being passed over for a job or fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Globally, women only earn 77 cents to the dollar when compared to men. According to a McKinsey Global Institute report, if women were to play an identical role in labor markets to that of men, as much as $28 trillion, or 26%, could be added to the global annual GDP by 2025. According to UNESCO, over 2.7 billion women are legally restricted from having the same choice of jobs as men. And women’s labor force participation rate is 48.5 % compared to a rate of 75% for men.  After looking at these staggering numbers, we see how biased gender diversity is even in the technological sector. Need of the hour With rapid industrialization and education about the importance of rights, gender diversity is very important in today’s world. Gender equality represents a society that has lesser violence and provides a safer world for everyone. It is also directly proportional to sustainable development and ensures human rights to everyone. As today’s markets are increasing along with customers’ preferences, to understand customer profiles and build products we need gender diversity in our organizations. Equal representation helps in a better decision-making process for a positive impact. Men and Women invest back into their families and having gender equality and diversity helps build values into families and households. Empowering individuals not only help themselves but also the economy of the nations. Gender equality and diversity should be built into organizations’ beliefs and values.   https://www.statista.com/chart/4467/female-employees-at-tech-companies/   Global Gender Gap Report (2017) Why is this happening? Perception: If we see the word “gender”, it is a socially constructed definition. And this definition changes as per different cultural norms. In a much broader term, our society is also not aware of the concept of binary and non-binary gender, which includes queer, Trans, and Intersex individuals as well. The socially acceptable thing is to have gender expressions as per our gender identity. So, when it comes to choosing their career, people tend to choose a job role that gives them higher social belongingness. E.g. We see more women(as compared to men) in nursing careers as it requires more feminine qualities. There are different versions of this perception: which we can see either in the society(in terms of socially assigned gender roles) or in the workplace(in the form of gender discrimination, stereotypical thinking, sexism, etc.). E.g. As per their assigned roles in society, women are most likely to take care of their family and children, and this affects their income and career growth. The motherhood penalty is a term defined by sociologists which states about the inverse correlation between income level and the number of children, i.e. there is also an income difference between a mother and a non-mother employee. As per OECD data(2012), there is a 7% reduction in wages for women per child. Lack of economic opportunities: Even in the tech industry, women are paid less than men. As per ILO data(2019), on average women are paid 20% less than men worldwide.  Even when it comes to promotion, men are preferred more. It is to be noted that the numbers are even worse when there is intersectionality involved. E.g., a transgender woman will be paid less than a white woman and so on. As per the National Centre for Transgender equality, one out of two transgender people faces adverse effects: including 23% were denied a promotion, 44% were passed over for a particular job position and 26% are fired from their workplace just because they are transgender.  Ways to improve gender diversity: We can improve this scenario from the perspective of different stakeholders who are involved. For Society : Creating Tech awareness from School level: As per the HDR report( 2017), no. of boys pursuing STEM program is 97% higher than girls. One way to improve this is to introduce more strong role models to advocate for this issue. Minority gender communities should be aware of the multiple job opportunities and career growth available in this field. These job roles are not even gender-specific anymore. For developing countries like India, STEM scholarship programs can be introduced from the secondary education level.  Address Bias/Stereotypes: It is to be noted that perceptions, stereotypes, and biases are not just something we learn in school but our upbringing also creates these, the things we watch, listen, and read daily. So, it also becomes the duty of the society to create a more inclusive environment. E.g. A more privileged person should fight for the fundamental right of the less empowered or less privileged person in society. There should be active encouragement from parents, teachers, and educators for students in STEM programs regardless of their gender identity. For Companies: To promote gender diversity in the workplace, companies need to focus on three things: Unbiased Recruitment policies: Generally, there is a lot of unconscious bias and prejudices when hiring women,74, trans, intersex, and queer individuals. There needs to be a diversity and inclusivity team in the HR itself that addresses these issues. A blind recruitment drive can be conducted where there is no need to mention gender in any of the documents. Having structured questions during the interview might help to remove any unconscious biases. Diversity sensitivity training: Workplace policies need to create a company image that hires everyone irrespective of their gender identity and can even keep it optional in all the job formalities and documents. Conducting proper sensitivity training to employees is essential as they need to use correct pronoun/gender-neutral language. Not just sensitivity training, strong workplace policies need to be in place which deal with any form of harassment or gender discrimination.  To create accountability and transparency in their process, companies can also share diversity and inclusivity company data. Retention policies: Creating Mentorship models:  Have a mentorship program in the workplace that advocates for women, trans, intersex, and non-binary individuals as leaders and encourages role models within this community.   Need to promote diversity in the workplace via proper workplace policies and legal guidelines(e.g. conducting mandatory sensitization training for all employees or framing zero-tolerance policies.)  Including proper maternity leaves, child care facilities, and flexibility of working hours/remote working arrangements can be helpful for minority gender in keeping their work-life balance. Develop support programs for these communities who are joining after maternity leave. It might be in terms of psychiatric or mentorship support. Increase Pay parities: It can be done in the following ways:  Create flexibility in job roles so that women can move on to higher positions. Build an inclusive workplace that supports pay parity— no salary difference based on gender for the same job roles. Create a transparent performance review process and ensure that there are no unconscious biases during the recruitment process. Doing a pay review within the organization to check how much pay difference exists before making framing policies.  Lastly, there needs to be proper government policies in place which provide a constitutional or legal framework starting from the basic education level. It may begin from increasing the gross enrollment rates of all students in schools (irrespective of their gender identity) for developing countries( like India) to have proper compensation policies in the workplace(as similar to what states like California, New York has adopted) to ensure pay parity.
